# Prompt Seeds

This directory contains detailed prompt templates for generating visual assets, UI components, and branding elements for the Curiosity Companion app.

## Purpose

These prompts ensure visual consistency across all generated assets by maintaining:
- A cohesive art direction inspired by Kurzgesagt and Brilliant
- Consistent color palettes and typography
- Unified motion design principles
- Desktop-optimized layouts and interactions

## Usage

When generating new assets:
1. Reference the appropriate prompt seed file(s)
2. Combine multiple seeds for complex assets (e.g., brand + visual-language + illustration)
3. Maintain the established geometric, educational, and vibrant aesthetic
