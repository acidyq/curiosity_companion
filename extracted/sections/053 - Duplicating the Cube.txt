Duplicating the Cube
I’ll briefly mention another cube problem: the third famous
‘geometric problem of antiquity’. It’s nowhere near as well
known as the other two – trisecting the angle and squaring the
circle. The traditional story is that an altar in the shape of a
perfect cube must be doubled in volume. This is equivalent to
                               pﬃﬃ
constructing a line of length 3 2 starting from the rational points
of the plane. The desired length satisfies another cubic equation,
this time the obvious one, x3  2 ¼ 0. For the same reason that
trisecting the angle is impossible, so is duplicating the cube, as
Pierre Wantzel pointed out in his 1837 paper. Cube-duplicators
are so rare that you hardly ever come across one.* Trisectors are

    squaring the circle nearly caused a rumpus in Indiana (page 25).
