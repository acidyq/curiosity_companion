Logical or Not?
       If pigs had wings, they’d fly.
       Pigs don’t fly if the weather is bad.
       If pigs had wings, the sensible person would carry an
       umbrella.
       Therefore:
       If the weather is bad, the sensible person would carry an
       umbrella.
       Is the deduction logically valid?
