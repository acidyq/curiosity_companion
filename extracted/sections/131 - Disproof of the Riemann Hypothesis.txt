Disproof of the Riemann Hypothesis
Consider the following logical argument:

. Elephants never forget.
. No creature that has ever won Mastermind has possessed a
    trunk.
. A creature that never forgets will always win Mastermind
    provided it takes part in the competition.
. A creature lacking a trunk is not an elephant.
. In 2001 an elephant took part in Mastermind.
Therefore:

. The Riemann Hypothesis is false.
Is this a correct deduction?
