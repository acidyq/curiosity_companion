The Most Likely Digit
If you look at a list of numerical data, and count how often a
given digit turns up as the first digit in each entry, which digit is
most likely? The obvious guess is that every digit has the same
chance of occurring as any other. But it turns out that for most
kinds of data, this is wrong.
    Here’s a typical data set – the areas of 18 islands in the
Bahamas. I’ve given the figures in square miles and in square
kilometres, for reasons I’ll shortly explain.

                                         The Most Likely Digit // 107



For the square mile data, the number of times that a given first
digit (shown in brackets) occurs goes like this:
       ð1Þ7 ð2Þ 2 ð3Þ 2 ð4Þ 0 ð5Þ 2 ð6Þ 2 ð7Þ 0 ð8Þ 1 ð9Þ 2

and 1 wins hands down. In square kilometres, the corresponding
numbers are
       ð1Þ 4 ð2Þ 6 ð3Þ 2 ð4Þ 2 ð5Þ 2 ð6Þ 0 ð7Þ 1 ð8Þ 1 ð9Þ 0

and now 2 wins, but only just.
    In 1938 the physicist Frank Benford observed that for long
enough lists of data, the numbers encountered by physicists and
engineers are most likely to start with the digit 1 and least likely
to start with 9. The frequency with which a given initial digit
occurs – that is, the probability that the first digit takes a given
value – decreases as the digits increase from 1 to 9. Benford
discovered empirically that the probability of encountering n as
the first decimal digit is
       log10 ðn þ 1Þ  log10 ðnÞ

where the subscript 10 means that the logarithms are to base ten.
(The value n = 0 is excluded because the initial digit is by
definition the first non-zero digit.) Benford called this formula the
law of anomalous numbers, but nowadays it’s usually known as
Benford’s law.

108 // The Most Likely Digit



   For the Bahama Island data, the frequencies look like this:




       Observed frequencies for the areas of the Bahama Islands,
       compared with Benford’s theoretical ideal.

    There are some differences between theory and reality, but
the data sets here are fairly small, so we would expect that. Even
with only 18 numbers, there is a strong prevalence of 1’s and 2’s
– which, according to Benford’s law, should between them occur
just over half the time.
    Benford’s formula is far from obvious, but a little thought
shows that the nine frequencies are unlikely to be identical.
Think of a street of houses, numbered from 1 upwards. The
probability of a given digit coming first varies considerably with
the number of houses on the street. If there are nine houses, each
digit occurs equally often. But, if there are 19, then the initial
digit is 1 for houses 1 and 10–19, a frequency of 11/19, or more
than 50%. As the length of the street increases, the frequency
with which a given first digit occurs wanders up and down in a
complicated but computable manner. The nine frequencies are
the same only when the number of houses is 9, 99, 999, and so on.
    Benford’s formula is distinguished by a beautiful property: it is
scale-invariant. If you measure the areas of Bahamian islands in
square miles or square kilometres, if you multiply house numbers
                                        Why Call It a Witch? // 109



by 7 or 93, then – provided you have a big enough sample – the
same law applies. In fact, Benford’s Law is the only scale-invariant
frequency law. It is unclear why nature prefers scale-invariant
frequencies, but it seems reasonable that the natural world should
not be affected by the units in which humans choose to measure
it.
    Tax collectors use Benford’s law to detect fake figures in tax
forms, because people who invent fictitious numbers tend to use
the same initial digits equally often. Probably because they think
