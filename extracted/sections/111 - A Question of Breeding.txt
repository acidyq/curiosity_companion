A Question of Breeding
Farmer Hogswill went to the village fete, where he met five of his
friends: Percy Catt, Dougal Dogge, Benjamin Hamster, Porky
Pigge and Zoe Zebra. By a remarkable coincidence – which was a
constant source of amusement – each of them was an expert
                                                Fair Shares // 181



breeder of one type of animal: cat, dog, hamster, pig and zebra.
Between them, they bred all five types. None bred an animal that
sounded like their surname.
   ‘Congratulations, Percy!’ said Hogswill. ‘I hear you’ve just
won third prize in the pig-breeding competition!’
   ‘That’s right,’ said Zoe.
   ‘And Benjamin got second for dogs!’
   ‘No,’ said Benjamin. ‘You knows fine well I never touches no
dogs. Nor zebras, neither.’
   Hogswill turned to the person whose surname sounded like
the animals that Zoe bred. ‘And did you win anything?’
   ‘Yes, a gold medal for my prize hamster.’
   Assuming that all statements except the alleged second for
dogs are true, who breeds what?
