How Old Was Diophantus?
A few pages back, in the section on Fermat’s Last Theorem, I
mentioned Diophantus of Alexandria, who lived around AD 250
and wrote a famous book on equations, the Arithmetica. That is
virtually all we know about him, except that a later source tells us
his age – assuming it is authentic. That source says this:
    Diophantus’s childhood lasted one-sixth of his life. His beard
grew after one-twelfth more. He married after one-seventh more.
His son was born five years later. The son lived to half his father’s
age. Diophantus died four years after his son. How old was
Diophantus when he died?

Ernst Kummer was a German algebraist, who did some of the best
work on Fermat’s Last Theorem before the modern era. However,
he was poor at arithmetic, so he always asked his students to do
the calculations for him. On one occasion he needed to work out
967. ‘Umm . . . nine times seven is . . . nine times . . . seven . . .

     ‘Sixty-one,’ suggested one student. Kummer wrote this on the
blackboard.
     ‘No, Professor! It should be sixty-seven!’ said another.
     ‘Come, come, gentlemen,’ said Kummer. ‘It can’t be both. It
