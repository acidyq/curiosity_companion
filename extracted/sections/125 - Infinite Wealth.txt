Infinite Wealth
During the early development of probability theory, a lot of
effort was expended – mainly by various members of the
Bernoulli family, which had four generations of able mathemat-
icians – on a strange puzzle, the St Petersburg paradox.
    You play against the bank, tossing a coin until it first lands
heads. The longer you keep tossing tails, the more the bank will
pay out. In fact, if you toss heads on the first try, the bank pays you
£2. If you first toss heads on the second try, the bank pays you £4. If
you first toss heads on the third try, the bank pays you £8. In
general, if you first toss heads on the nth try, the bank pays you £2n .
    The question is: how much should you be willing to pay to
take part in the game?
    To answer this, you should calculate your ‘expected’
winnings, in the long run, and the rules of probability tell you
how. The probability of a head on the first toss is 12, and you then
win £1, so the expected gain on the first toss is 12 62 ¼ 1. The
probability of a head first arising on the second toss is 14, and you
then win £4, so the expected gain on the second toss is 14 64 ¼ 1.
Continuing in this way, the expected gain on the nth toss is
2 n62n ¼ 1. In total, your expected winnings amount to
1


       1 þ 1 þ 1 þ 1 þ ...

going on forever, which is infinite. Therefore you should pay the
bank an infinite amount to play the game.
       What—if anything—is wrong here?
