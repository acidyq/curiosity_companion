Three Quickies
(1) After four bridge hands have been dealt, which is the more
likely: that you and your partner hold all the spades, or that you
and your partner hold no spades?

(2) If you took three bananas from a dish holding thirteen
bananas, how many bananas would you have?

(3) A secretary prints out six letters from the computer and

28 // Knight’s Tours



Knight’s Tours
The knight in chess has an unusual move. It can jump two
squares horizontally or vertically, followed by a single square at
right angles, and it hops over any intermediate pieces. The
geometry of the knight’s move has given rise to many
mathematical recreations, of which the simplest is the knight’s
tour. The knight is required to make a series of moves, visiting
each square on a chessboard (or any other grid of squares) exactly
once. The diagram shows a tour on a 565 board, and also shows
what the possible moves look like. This tour is not ‘closed’– that
is, the start and finish squares are not one knight’s move apart.
Can you find a closed tour on the 565 board?

                                                         knight’s tour,
                                                         and (right) a
                                                         partial 464
                                                         knight’s tour.


    I tried to find a 464 knight’s tour, but I got stuck after visiting
13 squares. Can you find a knight’s tour that visits all 16 squares?
If not, what is the largest number of squares that the knight can
visit?
    There is a vast literature on this topic. Good websites include:
