Prime Factoids
Prime numbers are among the most fascinating in the whole of
mathematics. Here’s a Prime Primer.
    A whole number bigger than 1 is prime if it is not the product
of two smaller numbers. The sequence of primes begins
       2; 3; 5; 7; 11; 13; 17; 19; 23; 29; 31; 37; . . .

Note that 1 is excluded, by convention. Prime numbers are of
fundamental importance in mathematics because every whole
number is a product of primes – for instance,

       2;007 ¼ 3636223
       2;008 ¼ 262626251
       2;009 ¼ 767641

Moreover (only mathematicians worry about this sort of thing,
but actually it’s kind of important and surprisingly difficult to
prove), there is only one way to achieve this, apart from
rearranging the order of the prime numbers concerned. For

instance, 2;008 ¼ 251626262, but that doesn’t count as differ-
ent. This property is called ‘unique prime factorisation’.
    If you’re worried about 1 here, mathematicians consider it to
be the product of no primes. Sorry, mathematics is like that
sometimes.
    The primes seem to be scattered fairly unpredictably. Apart
from 2, they are all odd – because an even number is divisible by
2, so it can’t be prime unless it is equal to 2. Similarly, 3 is the
only prime that is a multiple of 3, and so on.
    Euclid proved that there is no largest prime. In other words,
there exist infinitely many primes. Given any prime p, you can
always find a bigger one. In fact, any prime divisor of p! þ 1 will
do the job. Here p! ¼ p6ðp  1Þ6ðp  2Þ6    636261, a pro-
duct called the factorial of p. For instance,
       7! ¼ 7666564636261 ¼ 5;040:

The largest known prime is another matter, because Euclid’s
method isn’t a practical way to generate new primes explicitly.
As I write, the largest known prime is

       232;582;657  1

which has 9,808,358 digits when written out in decimal notation
(see page 153).
    Twin primes are pairs of primes that differ by 2. Examples are
(3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), and so on. The twin primes
conjecture states that there are infinitely many twin primes. This
is widely believed to be true, but has never been proved. Or
disproved. The largest known twin primes, to date, are:

       2;003;663;61362195;000  1 and 2;003;663;61362195;000 þ 1

with 58,711 digits each.
    Nicely does it . . . In 1994 Thomas Nicely was investigating
twin primes by computer, and noticed that his results disagreed
with previous computations. After spending weeks searching for
errors in his program, he traced the problem to a previously
unknown bug in the IntelTM PentiumTM microprocessor chip. At

that time, the Pentium was the central processing unit of most of
the world’s computers. See
