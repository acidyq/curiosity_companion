This ancient geometrical puzzle is easy if you look at it the right
way, and baffling if you don’t.




                                        Follow the rules to
                                        place nine counters.


     You have nine counters, to be placed on the circles in a five-
pointed star. Here I’ve numbered the circles to help explain the
solution. In the real game, there aren’t any numbers. Successive
counters must be positioned by placing them in an empty circle,
jumping over an adjacent circle (which may be empty or full) to
land on an empty circle adjacent to the one jumped over, so that
all three circles involved in the move are on the same straight
line. For instance, if circles 7 and 8 are empty, you can place a
counter on 7 and jump over 1 to land on 8. Here 1 can be empty
or full – it doesn’t matter. But you are not allowed to jump 7 over
1 to land on 4 or 5 because now the three circles involved are not
in a straight line.
     If you try placing counters at random, you usually run out of
suitable pairs of empty circles before finishing the puzzle.
