Pig on a Rope
Farmer Hogswill owns a field, which is a perfect equilateral
triangle, each side 100 metres long. His prize pig Pigasus is tied to
one corner, so that the portion of the field that Pigasus can reach
is exactly half the total area. How long is the rope?
    You may – indeed, must – assume that the pig has zero size
(which admittedly is pretty silly) and that the rope is infinitely
thin and any necessary knots can be ignored.




                                      Pigs may safely graze . . . over
                                      half the area of the field.
