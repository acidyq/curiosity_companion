White-Tailed Cats
‘I see you’ve got a cat,’ said Ms Jones to Ms Smith. ‘I do like its
cute white tail! How many cats do you have?’
     ‘Not a lot,’ said Ms Smith. ‘Ms Brown next door has twenty,
which is a lot more than I’ve got.’
     ‘You still haven’t told me how many cats you have!’
     ‘Well . . . let me put it like this. If you chose two distinct cats
of mine at random, the probability that both of them have white
tails is exactly one-half.’
     ‘That doesn’t tell me how many you’ve got!’
     ‘Oh yes it does.’
     How many cats does Ms Smith have – and how many have
white tails?
