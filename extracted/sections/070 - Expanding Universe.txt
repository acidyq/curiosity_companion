Expanding Universe
The starship Indefensible starts from the centre of a spherical
universe of radius 1,000 light years, and travels radially at a speed
of one light year per year – the speed of light. How long will it
take to reach the edge of the universe? Clearly, 1,000 years.
Except that I forgot to tell you that this universe is expanding.
Every year, the universe expands its radius instantly by precisely
1,000 light years. Now, how long will it take to reach the edge?
(Assume that the first such expansion happens exactly one year
after the Indefensible starts its voyage, and successive expansions
occur at intervals of exactly one year.)
    It might seem that the Indefensible never gets to the edge,
because that is receding faster than the ship can move. But at the
instant that the universe expands, the ship is carried along with
the space in which it sits, so its distance from the centre expands
proportionately. To make these conditions clear, let’s look at
what happens for the first few years.
    In the first year the ship travels 1 light year, and there are 999
light years left to traverse. Then the universe instantly expands
to a radius of 2,000 light years, and the ship moves with it. So it is
then 2 light years from the centre, and has 1,998 left to travel.
    In the next year it travels a further light year, to a distance of
3 light years, leaving 1,997. But then the universe expands to a
radius of 3,000 light-years, multiplying its radius by 1.5, so the
ship ends up 4.5 light years from the centre, and the remaining
distance increases to 2,995.5 light years.
    Does the ship ever get to the edge? If so, how long does it
take?

   Hint: it will be useful to know that the nth harmonic number

is approximately equal to
       log n þ g

where g is Euler’s constant, which is roughly 0.577 215 664 9.
