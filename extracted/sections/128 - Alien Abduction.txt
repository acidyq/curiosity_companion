Alien Abduction
Two aliens from the planet Porqupyne want to abduct two
Earthlings, but are blissfully unaware that the objects of their
                                   The Riemann Hypothesis // 215



attention are actually pigs. In their formal way, the aliens play a
game.




                                             First catch your pig . . .

    On the first move, each alien moves one square horizontally
or vertically (not diagonally). Each alien can move in any of the
four directions, independently of what the other one does. On
the next move, the pigs can do likewise. The aliens get to abduct
any pig upon whose square they land. To their surprise, the pigs
always seem to get away. What are the aliens doing wrong?
