Pythagorean Triples
I can’t really get away without telling you Diophantus’s method
for finding all Pythagorean triples, can I?
    OK, here it is. Take any two whole numbers, and form:

. twice their product
. the difference between their squares
. the sum of their squares
Then the resulting three numbers are the sides of a Pythagorean
triangle.
    For instance, take the numbers 2 and 1. Then

. twice their product ¼ 26261 ¼ 4
. the difference between their squares ¼ 22  12 ¼ 3
. the sum of their squares ¼ 22 þ 12 ¼ 5
and we obtain the famous 3–4–5 triangle. If instead we take
numbers 3 and 2, then

. twice their product ¼ 26362 ¼ 12
. the difference between their squares ¼ 32  22 ¼ 5
. the sum of their squares ¼ 32 þ 22 ¼ 13
and we get the next-most-famous 5–12–13 triangle. Taking
numbers 42 and 23, on the other hand, leads to

. twice their product ¼ 2642623 ¼ 1;932

*   If you think you’ve found it, please don’t send it to me. I get too
    many attempted proofs as it is, and so far – well, just don’t get me
    started, OK?

. the difference between their squares ¼ 422  232 ¼ 1;235
. the sum of their squares ¼ 422 þ 232 ¼ 2;293
and no one has ever heard of the 1,2351,9322,293 triangle.
But these numbers do work:

       1;2352 þ 1;9322 ¼ 1;525;225 þ 3;732;624 ¼ 5;257;849
                      ¼ 2;2932

There’s a final twist to Diophantus’s rule. Having worked out the
three numbers, we can choose any other number we like and
multiply them all by that. So the 3–4–5 triangle can be converted
to a 6–8–10 triangle by multiplying all three numbers by 2, or to
a 15–20–25 triangle by multiplying all three numbers by 5. We
can’t get these two triples from the above prescription using

whole numbers. Diophantus knew that.
