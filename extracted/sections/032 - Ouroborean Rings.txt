Ouroborean Rings
Around 1960 the American mathematician Sherman K. Stein
discovered a curious pattern in the Sanskrit nonsense word
yamátárájabhánasalagám. The composer George Perle told Stein
that the stressed (á ) and unstressed (a) syllables form a
mnemonic for rhythms, and correspond to long and short
beats. Thus the first three syllables, ya má tá, have the rhythm
short, long, long. The second to fourth are má tá rá, long, long,
long – and so on. There are eight possible triplets of long or
short rhythms, and each occurs in the nonsense word exactly
once.
    Stein rewrote the word using 0 for short and 1 for long,
                                               The Ourotorus // 45



getting 0111010001. Then he noticed that the first two digits are
the same as the last two, so the string of digits can be bent into a
loop, swallowing its own tail. Now you can generate all possible
sequences of three digits 0 and 1 by moving along the loop one
space at a time:
       0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 ...
       0 1 1
         1 1 1
           1 1 0
             1 0 1
               0 1 0
                 1 0 0
                   0 0 0
                     0 0                1

I call such sequences ouroborean rings, after the mythical serpent
Ouroboros, which eats its own tail.
    There is an ouroborean ring for pairs: 0011. It is unique
except for rotations. Your task is to find one for quadruplets.
That is, arrange eight 0’s and eight 1’s in a ring so that every
possible string of four digits, from 0000 to 1111, appears as a
series of consecutive symbols. (Each string of four must then
occur exactly once.)
