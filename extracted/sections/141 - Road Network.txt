Road Network
Four towns – Aylesbury, Beelsbury, Ceilsbury and Dealsbury – lie
at the corners of a square, of side 100 km. The highways
department wishes to connect them all together using the
shortest possible network of roads.

                                        Not like this.



    ‘We can run roads straight from Aylesbury to Beelsbury to
Ceilsbury to Dealsbury,’ said the assistant town planner. ‘That’s
300 km of roads.’
    ‘No, we can do better than that!’ his boss replied. ‘Two
diagonals, which, if you recall your Pythagoras, amount to
     p
200 2 km – about 282 km.’
    What is the shortest network? Using the diagonals of the square
is not the answer.
