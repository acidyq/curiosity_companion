Perpetual Calendar
In 1957 John Singleton patented a desk calendar that could
represent any date from 01 to 31 using two cubes, but he let the
patent lapse in 1965. Each cube bears six digits, one on each face.
                                                     A two-cube
                                                     calendar, and
                                                     two of the days
                                                     it can represent.

   The picture shows how such a calendar represents the 5th
and the 25th day of the month. I have intentionally omitted any
other numbers from the faces. You are allowed to place the cubes
with any of the six faces showing, and you can also put the grey
one on the left and the white one on the right.
   What are the numbers on the two cubes?

Mathematical Jokes 1*
A biologist, a statistician and a mathematician are sitting outside
a cafe watching the world go by. A man and a woman enter a
building across the road. Ten minutes later, they come out
accompanied by a child.
    ‘They’ve reproduced,’ says the biologist.

*   The purpose of these jokes is not primarily to make you laugh. It
    is to show you what makes mathematicians laugh, and to provide
    you with a glimpse into an obscure corner of the world’s
    mathematical subculture.

    ‘No,’ says the statistician. ‘It’s an observational error. On
average, two and a half people went each way.’
    ‘No, no, no,’ says the mathematician. ‘It’s perfectly obvious.

If someone goes in now, the building will be empty.’
