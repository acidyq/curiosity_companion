What is e, and Why?
The number e, which is approximately 2.7182, is the ‘base of
natural logarithms’, a term that refers to its historical origins.
One way to see how it arises is to see how a sum of money grows
when compound interest is applied at increasingly fine intervals.
Suppose that you deposit £1 in the Bank of Logarithmania—
    No, no, no. This is the twenty-first century. People don’t
deposit savings in banks, they borrow.
    OK, suppose you borrow £1 on your Logarithmania credit
card. (More likely it would be £4,675.23, but £1 is easier to think
about.) Once the 0% balance transfer deal has lapsed – about a
week after you sign up for the card – the bank applies an interest
rate of 100%, paid annually. Then after one year you will owe
them
       £1:00 borrowed þ £1:00 interest ¼ £2:00 total

If instead you paid 50% interest every six months, compounded
(so that interest becomes payable on previous interest) then after
one year you would owe
       £1:00 invested þ £0:50 interest þ £0:75 interest ¼ £2:25 total

This is ð1 þ 12Þ2 , and the pattern continues like that. So, for
example, if you paid interest of 10% at intervals of one-tenth of a
year, you would end up owing
                  
                1 10
          1þ          ¼ 2:5937
               10

pounds. The Bank likes the way these sums are going, so it
decides to apply the interest rate ever more frequently. If you
paid interest of 1% at intervals of one-hundredth of a year, you
would end up owing
               
              1 100
         1þ         ¼ 2:7048
             100

pounds. If you paid interest of 0.1% at intervals of one-
thousandth of a year, you would end up owing
                 1;000
              1
        1þ               ¼ 2:7169
            1;000

pounds. And so on.
     As the intervals become ever finer, the amount you owe does
not increase without limit. It just seems that way. The amount
owed gets closer and closer to 2.7182 pounds – and this number
is given the symbol e. It’s one of those weird numbers which, like
p, turn up naturally in mathematics but can’t be expressed
exactly as a fraction, so it gets a special symbol. It is especially
important in calculus, and it is widely used in scientific

applications.



May Husband and Ay . . .
In a single move, a chess queen can travel any number of squares
in a straight line – horizontally, vertically or diagonally. (Unless
another piece stops her, but we ignore that in this puzzle.)




                                     Move the queen from Q to K,
                                     visiting each square exactly
                                     once and in as few moves as
                                     possible.


    She starts on square Q and wishes to visit the king on square
K. Along the way, she wants to visit all of her other subjects, who
live on the other 62 squares. Just passing through, you appreciate
– she doesn’t stop on every square, but she does has to stop now
and again. How can she visit all the squares and finish at the

king’s square, without passing through any square twice – in the
smallest number of moves?
