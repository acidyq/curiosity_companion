All Triangles are Isosceles
This puzzle requires some knowledge of Euclidean geometry,
which nowadays isn’t taught . . . Ho hum. It’s still accessible if
you’re prepared to take a few facts on trust.
    An isosceles triangle has two sides equal. (The third could also
be equal: this makes the triangle equilateral, but it still counts as
isosceles too.) Since it is easy to draw triangles with all three sides
different, the title of this section is clearly false. Nevertheless,
here is a geometric proof that it is true.




                                            This triangle is isosceles –
                                            except that it clearly isn’t.




(1) Take any triangle ABC.

(2) Draw a line CX that cuts the top angle in half, so that angles a
and b are equal. Draw a line MX at right angles to the bottom
edge at its midpoint, so that AM = MB. This meets the previous
line, CX, somewhere inside the triangle at the point X.

(3) Draw lines from X to the other two corners A and B. Draw XD
and XE to make angles c, d, e and f all right angles.

(4) Triangles CXD and CXE are congruent – that is, they have the
same shape and size (though one is the other flipped over). The
204 // Square Year



reason is that angles a and b are equal, angles c and d are equal,
and the side CX is common to both triangles.

(5)    Therefore lines CD and CE are equal.

(6)    So are lines XD and XE.

(7) Since M is the midpoint of AB and MX is at right angles to
AB, the lines XA and XB are equal.

(8) But now triangles XDA and XEB are congruent. The reason is
that XD = XE, XA = XB and angle e equals angle f.

(9)    Therefore DA = EB.

(10) Combining steps 5 and 9: CA ¼ CD þ DA ¼ CE þ EB ¼ CB.
So lines CA and CB are equal, and triangle ABC is isosceles.

What’s wrong here? (Hint: it’s not the use of congruent triangles.)
