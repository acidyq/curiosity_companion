Tap-an-Animal
This is a great mathematical party trick for children. They take
turns to choose an animal. Then they spell out its name while
you, or another child, tap successive points of the ten-pointed
star. You must start at the point labelled ‘Rhinoceros’, and move
in a clockwise direction along the lines. Miraculously, as they say
the final letter, you tap the correct animal.




                                                    Spell the name
                                                    to find the
                                                    animal.

   How does it work? Well, the third word along the star is ‘Cat’,
which has three letters, the fourth is ‘Lion’, with four, and so on.
To help conceal the trick, the animals in positions 0, 1 and 2
have 10, 11 and 12 letters. Since 10 taps takes you back to where
you started, everything works out perfectly.
   To conceal the trick, use pictures of the animals – in the
