Drawing an Ellipse – and More?
It is well known that an easy way to draw an ellipse is to fix two
pins through the paper, tie a loop of string round them, and
place your pencil so that the string stays taut. Gardeners
sometimes use this method to map out elliptical flowerbeds. The
two pins are the foci (plural of focus, and pronounced ‘foe-sigh’)
of the ellipse.




                                        How to draw an ellipse.

  That ought to give some interesting new kinds of curves. So
why don’t the mathematics books mention them?
