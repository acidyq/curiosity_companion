How Deep is the Well?
In one episode of the television series Time Team, the indefatig-
able archaeologists want to measure the depth of a mediaeval
well. They drop something into it and time its fall, which takes an
amazingly long six seconds. You hear it clattering its way down
for ages. They come dangerously close to calculating the depth
using Newton’s laws of motion, but cop out at the last moment
and use three very long tape measures joined together instead.
    The formula they very nearly state is

        s ¼ 12 gt2

where s is the distance travelled under gravity, falling from rest,
and g is the acceleration due to gravity. It applies when air
resistance can be ignored. This formula was discovered experi-
mentally by Galileo Galilei and later generalised by Isaac Newton
to describe motion under the influence of any force.
     Taking g ¼ 10 m s2 (metres per second per second), how deep
is the well?
     You’ve got three days to do it.

McMahon’s Squares
This puzzle was invented by the combinatorialist* P.A.
McMahon in 1921. He was thinking about a square that has been
divided into four triangular regions by diagonals. He wondered
how many different ways there are to colour the various regions,

using three colours. He discovered that if rotations and
reflections are regarded as the same colouring, there are exactly
24 possibilities. Find them all.
    Now, a 664 rectangle contains 24 161 squares. Can you fit
the 24 squares together to make such a rectangle, so that
adjacent regions have the same colour, and the entire perimeter
of the rectangle has the same colour?
