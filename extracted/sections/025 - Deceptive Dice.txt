Deceptive Dice
The Terrible Twins, Innumeratus and Mathophila, were bored.
    ‘I know,’ said Mathophila brightly. ‘Let’s play dice!’
    ‘Don’t like dice.’
    ‘Ah, but these are special dice,’ said Mathophila, digging them
out of an old chocolate box. One was red, one yellow and one
blue.
    Innumeratus picked up the red dice.* ‘There’s something
funny about this one,’ he said. ‘It’s got two 3’s, two 4’s and two 8’s.’
    ‘They’re all like that,’ said Mathophila carelessly. ‘The yellow
one has two 1’s, two 5’s and two 9’s – and the blue one has two
2’s, two 6’s and two 7’s.’
    ‘They look rigged to me,’ said Innumeratus, deeply suspicious.
    ‘No, they’re perfectly fair. Each face has an equal chance of
turning up.’
    ‘How do we play, anyway?’
    ‘We each choose a different one. We roll them simulta-
neously, and the highest number wins. We can play for pocket
money.’ Innumeratus looked sceptical, so his sister quickly
added: ‘Just to be fair, I’ll let you choose first! Then you can
choose the best dice!’
    ‘Weeelll . . . ’ said Innumeratus, hesitating.
    Should he play? If not, why not?

*   Strictly speaking, ‘dice’ is the plural, and I should have used ‘die’ –
    but I’ve given up fighting that particular battle. I mention this to
    stop people writing in to tell me I’ve got it wrong. Anyway, the
    proverb tells us ‘never say die’.
