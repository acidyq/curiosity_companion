Mathematical Jokes 3
Two mathematicians in a cocktail bar are arguing about how

for the gents. While he is gone, his colleague calls the waitress
over.
    ‘Listen, there’s ten pounds in it for you if you come over
when my friend gets back and answer a question. The answer is
‘‘one-third x cubed.’’ Got that?’
    ‘Ten pounds for saying ‘‘One thirdex cue?’’ ’

    ‘One thir dex cubed?’
    ‘Yeah, that’ll do.’
    The other mathematician comes back, and the waitress
