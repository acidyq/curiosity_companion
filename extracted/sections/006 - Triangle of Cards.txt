Triangle of Cards
I have 15 cards, numbered consecutively from 1 to 15. I want to
lay them out in a triangle. I’ve put numbers on the top three for
later reference:




                             Triangle of cards.

    However, I don’t want any old arrangement. I want each card
to be the difference between the two cards immediately below it,
                                       Pop-up Dodecahedron // 7



to left and right. For example, 5 is the difference between 4 and
9. (The differences are always calculated so that they are
positive.) This condition does not apply to the cards in the
bottom row, you appreciate.
    The top three cards are already in place – and correct. Can
you find how to place the remaining twelve cards?
    Mathematicians have found ‘difference triangles’ like this
with two, three or four rows of cards, bearing consecutive whole
numbers starting from 1. It has been proved that no difference
triangle can have six or more rows.
