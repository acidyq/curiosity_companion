Richard’s Paradox
In 1905 Jules Richard, a French logician, invented a very curious
paradox. In the English language, some sentences define positive
integers and others do not. For example ‘The year of the
Declaration of Independence’ defines 1776, whereas ‘The
historical significance of the Declaration of Independence’ does
not define a number. So what about this sentence: ‘The smallest
number that cannot be defined by a sentence in the English
language containing fewer than 20 words.’ Observe that what-
198 // Richard’s Paradox



ever this number may be, we have just defined it using a sentence
in the English language containing only 19 words. Oops.
     A plausible way out is to say that the proposed sentence does
not actually define a specific number. However, it ought to. The
English language contains a finite number of words, so the
number of sentences with fewer than 20 words is itself finite. Of
course, many of these sentences make no sense, and many of
those that do make sense don’t define a positive integer – but
that just means that we have fewer sentences to consider.
Between them, they define a finite set of positive integers, and it
is a standard theorem of mathematics that in such circumstances
there is a unique smallest positive integer that is not in the set. So
on the face of it, the sentence does define a specific positive
integer.
     But logically, it can’t.
     Possible ambiguities of definition such as ‘A number which
when multiplied by zero gives zero’ don’t let us off the logical
hook. If a sentence is ambiguous, then we rule it out, because an
ambiguous sentence doesn’t define anything. Is the troublesome
sentence ambiguous, then? Uniqueness is not the issue: there
can’t be two distinct smallest-numbers-not-definable-(etc.),
because one must be smaller than the other.
     One possible escape route involves how we decide which
sentences do or do not define a positive integer. For instance, if
we go through them in some kind of order, excluding bad ones
in turn, then the sentences that survive depend on the order in
which they are considered. Suppose that two consecutive
sentences are:

(1) The number in the next valid sentence plus one.

(2) The number in the previous valid sentence plus two.

These sentences cannot both be valid – they would then
contradict each other. But once we have excluded one of them,
the other one is valid, because it now refers to a different
sentence altogether.
                                 Are Hard Problems Easy? // 199



    Forbidding this type of sentence puts us on a slippery slope,
with more and more sentences being excluded for various
reasons. All of which strongly suggests that the alleged sentence
does not, in fact, define a specific number – even though it seems
