Anti-Atheism
Godfrey Harold Hardy, a Cambridge mathematician who worked
mainly in analysis, claimed to believe in God – but unlike most
believers, he considered the Deity to be his personal enemy.
Hardy had it in for God, and he was convinced that God had it in
for Hardy, which was only fair. Hardy was especially worried
whenever he travelled by sea, in case God sank the boat. So
before travelling, he would send his colleagues a telegram: ‘HAVE
PROVED RIEMANN HYPOTHESIS. HARDY.’ He would then retract this
claim on arrival.
    As just discussed, the Riemann Hypothesis is the most
famous unsolved problem in mathematics, and one of the most
important. And so it was in Hardy’s day, too. When his
colleagues asked him why he sent such telegrams, he explained
that God would never let him die if that would give him credit –
