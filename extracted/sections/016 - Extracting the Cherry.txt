Extracting the Cherry
This puzzle is a golden oldie, with a simple but elusive answer.
    The cocktail cherry is inside the glass, which is formed from
four matches. Your task is to move at most two of the matches,
so that the cherry is then outside the glass. You can turn the glass
sideways or upside down if you wish, but the shape must remain
the same.




                     Move two matches
                     to extract the cherry.
