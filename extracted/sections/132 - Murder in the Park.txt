Murder in the Park
This puzzle – like several in this book – goes back to the great
English puzzlist Henry Ernest Dudeney. He called it ‘Ravensdene
Park’. I’ve made a few trivial changes.




                                                 Ravensdene Park.

   Soon after a heavy fall of snow, Cyril Hastings entered
Ravensdene Park at gate D, walked straight to the position

marked with a black dot, and was stabbed through the heart. His
body was found the next morning, along with several tracks in
the snow. The police immediately closed the park.
    Their subsequent investigations revealed that each track had
been made by a different, very distinctive shoe. Witnesses placed
four individuals, other than Hastings, in the park during the
period concerned. So the murderer had to be one of them.
Examining their shoes, the police deduced that:

. The butler – who could prove he had been in the house X at
   the time of the murder – had entered at gate E and gone to X.
. The gamekeeper – who had no such alibi – had entered at gate
   A and gone to his lodge at Y.
. A local youth had entered at gate G and left by gate B.
. The grocer’s wife had entered at gate C and left by gate F.
None of these individuals entered or left the park more than
once.
   It had been foggy as well as snowy, so the routes these people
took were often rather indirect. The police did notice that no two
paths crossed. But they failed to make a sketch of the routes
before the snow melted and they disappeared.
   So who was the murderer?
