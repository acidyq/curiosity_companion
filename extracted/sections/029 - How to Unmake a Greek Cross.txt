How to Unmake a Greek Cross
To paraphrase the old music-hall joke, almost any insult will
make a Greek cross. But what I want you to do is unmake a Greek
cross. In this region of Puzzledom, a Greek cross is five equal
squares joined to make a þ shape. I want you to convert it to a
square, by cutting it into pieces and reassembling them. Here’s
one solution, using five pieces. But can you find an alternative,
using four pieces, all the same shape?




                                                       Greek cross to
                                                       square in five
                                                       pieces. Now
                                                       do it with four.
