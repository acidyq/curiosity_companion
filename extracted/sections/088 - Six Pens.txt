Six Pens
Farmer Hogswill has run into another mathematico-agricultural
problem. He had carefully assembled 13 identical fence panels to
create 6 identical pens for his rare-breed Alexander-horned pigs.
But during the night some antisocial person stole one of his
panels. So now he needs to use 12 fence panels to create 6
identical pens. How can he achieve this? All 12 panels must be
used.

                                                   making 6 pens.
