The Stolen Car
Nigel Fenderbender bought a secondhand car for £900 and
advertised it in the local paper for £2,900. A respectable-looking
elderly gentleman dressed as a clergyman turned up at the
doorstep and enquired about the car, and bought it at the asking
price. However, he mistakenly made his cheque out for £3,000,
and it was the last cheque in his chequebook.
    Now, Fenderbender had no cash in the house, so he nipped
next door to the local newsagent, Maggie Zine, who was a
friend of his, and got her to change the cheque. He paid the
clergyman £100 change. However, when Maggie tried to pay
the cheque in at the bank, it bounced. In order to pay back the
newsagent, she was forced to borrow £3,000 from another
friend, Honest Harry.
    After Fenderbender had repaid this debt as well, he
complained vociferously: ‘I lost £2,000 profit on the car, £100 in
                                           Space-Filling Curves // 83



change, £3,000 repaying the newsagent and another £3,000
repaying Honest Harry. That’s £8,100 altogether!’
   How much money had he actually lost?
