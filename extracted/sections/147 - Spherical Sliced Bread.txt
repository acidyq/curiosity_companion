Spherical Sliced Bread
Araminta Ponsonby took her two sets of quins to the Archimedes
bakery, which makes spherical loaves. She likes to go there
because each loaf is cut into ten slices, of equal thickness, so each
child can have one slice of bread. They have different appetites –
which is fortunate because some slices have smaller volume than
others. But, being extremely well-behaved, all ten children love
the crust, and want as much as they can get.
    Which slice has the most crust?


                                          The slices are the same
                                          thickness: which has the
                                          most crust?




    Assume that the loaf is a perfect sphere, the slices are formed
by parallel equally spaced planes, and the crust is infinitely thin –
so the amount of crust on each slice is equal to the area of the
corresponding part of the sphere’s surface.
