River Crossing 1 – Farm Produce
Alcuin of Northumbria, aka Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus or
Ealhwine, was a scholar, a clergyman and a poet. He lived in the
eighth century and rose to be a leading figure at the court of the
emperor Charlemagne. He included this puzzle in a letter to the
emperor, as an example of ‘subtlety in Arithmetick, for your
enjoyment’. It still has mathematical significance, as I’ll
eventually explain. It goes like this.
    A farmer is taking a wolf, a goat and a basket of cabbages to
market, and he comes to a river where there is a small boat. He
can fit only one item of the three into the boat with him at any
time. He can’t leave the wolf with the goat, or the goat with the
cabbages, for reasons that should be obvious. Fortunately the
wolf detests cabbage. How does the farmer transport all three
items across the river?
