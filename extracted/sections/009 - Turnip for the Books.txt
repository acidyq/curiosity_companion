Turnip for the Books
‘It’s been a good year for turnips,’ farmer Hogswill remarked to
his neighbour, Farmer Suticle.
     ‘Yup, that it has,’ the other replied. ‘How many did you grow?’
     ‘Well . . . I don’t exactly recall, but I do remember that when
I took the turnips to market, I sold six-sevenths of them, plus
one-seventh of a turnip, in the first hour.’
     ‘Must’ve been tricky cuttin’ ’em up.’
     ‘No, it was a whole number that I sold. I never cuts ’em.’
     ‘If’n you say so, Hogswill. Then what?’
     ‘I sold six-sevenths of what was left, plus one-seventh of a
turnip, in the second hour. Then I sold six-sevenths of what was
left, plus one-seventh of a turnip, in the third hour. And finally I
sold six-sevenths of what was left, plus one-seventh of a turnip,
in the fourth hour. Then I went home.’
     ‘Why?’
     ‘’Cos I’d sold the lot.’
     How many turnips did Hogswill take to market?
