Two Perpendiculars
Euclidean geometry is renowned for its logical consistency: no
two theorems contradict each other. Actually, there are errors in
Euclid. Here’s a case in point.
   One of Euclid’s theorems proves that if we have a line, and a
point not on the line, then there is exactly one ‘perpendicular’
from the point to the line. That is, there is a line through the
point that meets the original line at right angles – and there is
only one such line. (If there were two, they would be parallel, so
they couldn’t both pass through the same point.)




       Given AB and X, we can find P such that PX is perpendicular to
       AB. There can’t be another point Q like that, because the line
       through Q is parallel to PX so it can’t pass through X.

    A second Euclidean theorem proves that if you take a circle
and join the two ends of a diameter to a point on the
circumference, you get a right angle.

                                      If AB is a diameter of the
                                      circle, angle APB is a right
                                      angle.


   Let’s put these two theorems together and see what happens.

                                      perpendiculars.


    Given the line AB and the point X, draw circles with
diameters AX and BX. Let the line AB meet the first circle at P and
the second circle at Q. Then the angle APX is a right angle, since
AX is a diameter of the first circle. Similarly, the angle BQX is a
right angle. So there are two perpendiculars XP and XQ from X to
AB.
    Which of Euclid’s two theorems is wrong?
