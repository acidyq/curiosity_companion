River Crossing 2 – Marital Mistrust
Remember Alcuin’s letter to Charlemagne (page 20) and the
wolf–goat–cabbage puzzle? The same letter contained a more
complicated river-crossing puzzle, which may have been
invented by the Venerable Bede fifty or so years earlier. It came to
prominence in Claude-Gaspar Bachet’s seventeenth-century
compilation Pleasant and Delectable Problems, where it was posed
as a problem about jealous husbands who did not trust their
wives in the company of other men.
    It goes like this. Three jealous husbands with their wives must
cross a river, and find a boat with no boatman. The boat can
carry only two of them at once. How can they all cross the river
                             Wherefore Art Thou Borromeo? // 87



so that no wife is left in the company of other men without her
husband being present?
    Both men and women may row. All husbands are jealous in
the extreme: they do not trust their unaccompanied wives to be
with another man, even if the other man’s wife is also present.
