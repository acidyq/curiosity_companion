The Milk Crate Problem
Here’s a simpler question of the same kind. A milkman wishes to
pack identical bottles, with circular cross-section, into a square
crate. To him, it’s obvious that for any given square number of
bottles – 1, 4, 9, 16, and so on – the crate can be made as small as
possible by packing the bottles in a regular square array. (He can
see that with a non-square number of bottles, there are gaps and
maybe the bottles can be jiggled around to shrink the crate.)
    Is he right?

                                    16 bottles into the
                                    smallest possible
                                    square crate.
