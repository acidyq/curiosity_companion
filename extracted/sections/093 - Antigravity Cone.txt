Antigravity Cone
In defiance of the Law of Gravity, this double cone rolls uphill.
Here’s how to make it.




                                                       Five pieces
                                                       to cut out.

    Copy the five shapes on to a thin sheet of card, two or three
times the size shown here, and cut them out. On piece A, glue
flap v to edge v to make a cone. On piece B, glue flap w to edge w
to make a second cone. Then glue the two cones base to base
using the triangular flaps on A.
    Glue flap x of C to edge x of D, and flap y of C to edge y of E.
Finally, glue flap z of D to edge z of E to make a triangular ‘fence’.
    Place the double cone at the lower end of this triangle, and
let go. It will appear to roll uphill.
    How can this happen?




                                              A rolling cone gathers
                                              no gravity.
