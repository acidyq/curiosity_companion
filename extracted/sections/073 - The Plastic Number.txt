The Plastic Number
The plastic number is a little-known relative of the famous
golden number. We’ve just seen how the Fibonacci numbers
create a spiralling system of squares, related to the golden
number. There is a similar spiral diagram for the plastic number,
but composed of equilateral triangles. In the diagram below, the
initial triangle is marked in black and successive triangles spiral
in a clockwise direction: the spiral shown is again roughly
logarithmic. In order to make the shapes fit, the first three
triangles all have side 1. The next two have side 2, and then the
numbers go 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 21, and so on.

   Again there is a simple rule for finding these numbers,
analogous to that for Fibonacci numbers: each number in the
sequence is the sum of the previous number but one, together
with the one before that. For example,
       12 ¼ 7 þ 5; 16 ¼ 9 þ 7; 21 ¼ 12 þ 9

This pattern follows from the way the triangles fit together. If Pn
is the nth Padovan number (starting from P0 ¼ P1 ¼ P2 ¼ 1),
then
       Pn ¼ Pn2 þ Pn3
104 // The Plastic Number



The first twenty numbers in the sequence are:

       1; 1; 1; 2; 2; 3; 4; 5; 7; 9; 12; 16;
       21; 28; 37; 49; 65; 86; 114; 151

I call this sequence the Padovan numbers because the architect
Richard Padovan told me about them, although he denies any
responsibility. Curiously, ‘Pádova’ is the Italian form of ‘Padua’,
and Fibonacci was from Pisa, roughly a hundred miles away. I am
tempted to rename the Fibonacci numbers ‘Pisan numbers’ to
reflect the Italian geography, but as you can see I managed to
resist.
     The plastic number, which I denote by p, is roughly 1.324718.
It is related to the Padovan numbers in the same way that the
golden number is related to the Fibonacci numbers. That is,
ratios of successive Padovan numbers, such as 49/37 or 151/114,
give good approximations to the plastic number. The pattern of
the sequence of Padovan numbers leads to the equation
p3  p  1 ¼ 0, and p is the unique real solution of this cubic
equation. The Padovan sequence increases much more slowly
than the Fibonacci sequence because p is smaller than f. There
are many interesting patterns in the Padovan sequence. For
example, the diagram shows that 21 ¼ 16 þ 5, because triangles
adjacent along a suitable edge have to fit together; similarly,
16 ¼ 12 þ 4; 12 ¼ 9 þ 3, and so on. Therefore
       Pn ¼ Pn1 þ Pn5

which is an alternative rule for deriving further terms of the
sequence. This equation implies that p5  p4  1 ¼ 0, and it is not
immediately obvious that p, defined as a solution of a cubic

equation, must also satisfy this quintic (fifth-degree) equation.
