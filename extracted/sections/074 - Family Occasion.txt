Family Occasion
‘It was a wonderful party,’ said Lucilla to her friend Harriet.
    ‘Who was there?’
    ‘Well – there was one grandfather, one grandmother, two
fathers, two mothers, four children, three grandchildren, one
brother, two sisters, two sons, two daughters, one father-in-law,
one mother-in-law and one daughter-in-law.’
    ‘Wow! Twenty-three people!’
    ‘No, it was less than that. A lot less.’
    What is the smallest size of party that is consistent with
Lucilla’s description?

Don’t Let Go!
Topology is a branch of mathematics in which two shapes are
‘the same’ if one can be continuously deformed into the other.
So you can bend, stretch, and shrink, but not cut. This ancient
topological chestnut still has many attractions – in particular,
not everyone has seen it before. What you have to do is pick up a
length of rope, with the left hand holding one end and the right
hand holding the other, and tie a knot in the rope without letting
go of the ends.
