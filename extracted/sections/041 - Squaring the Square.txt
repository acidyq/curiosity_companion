Squaring the Square
We all know that a rectangular floor can be tiled with square tiles
of equal size – provided its edges are integer (whole-number)
multiples of the size of the tile. But what happens if we are
required to use square tiles which all have different sizes?
    The first ‘squared rectangle’ was published in 1925 by
Zbigniew Morón, using ten square tiles of sizes 3, 5, 6, 11, 17, 19,
22, 23, 24 and 25.




                                                        Morón’s first
                                                        squared
                                                        rectangle.


    Not long after, he found a squared rectangle using nine
square tiles with sizes 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15 and 18. Can you
arrange these tiles to make a rectangle? As a hint, it has size 32633.
    What about making a square out of different square tiles? For
                                          Squaring the Square // 63



a long time this was thought to be impossible, but in 1939
Roland Sprague found 55 distinct square tiles that fit together to
make a square. In 1940 four mathematicians (Leonard Brooks,
Cedric Smith, Arthur Stone and William Tutte, then under-
graduates at Trinity College, Cambridge) published a paper
relating the problem to electrical networks – the network
encodes what size the squares are, and how they fit together. This
method led to more solutions.




       Willcocks’s squared square with 24 tiles.

    In 1948 Theophilus Willcocks found 24 squares that fit
together to make a square. For a while it was thought that no
smaller set would do the job, but in 1962 Adrianus Duijvestijn
used a computer to show that only 21 square tiles are needed,
and this is the minimum number. Their sizes are 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9,
11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 24, 25, 27, 29, 33, 35, 37, 42 and 50. Can
you arrange Duijvestijn’s 21 tiles to make a square? As a hint, it has
size 1126112.
    Finally, a really hard one: can you tile the infinite plane,
64 // Magic Squares



leaving no gaps, using exactly one tile of each whole number
size: 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on? This problem remained open until
2008, when Frederick and James Henle proved that you can. See
their article ‘Squaring the plane’, American Mathematical Monthly,
volume 115 (2008), pages 3–12.
