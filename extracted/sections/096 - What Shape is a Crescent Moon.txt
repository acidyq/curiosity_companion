What Shape is a Crescent Moon?
The Moon is low in the sky shortly after sunset or before dawn;
the bright part of its surface forms a beautiful crescent. The two
curves that form the boundary of the crescent resemble arcs of
circles, and are often drawn that way. Assuming the Moon to be a
perfect sphere, and the Sunâ€™s rays to be parallel, are they arcs of
circles?




                             A crescent formed
                             by two arcs of
                             circles. Is the crescent
                             Moon like this?
