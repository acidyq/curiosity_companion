Connecting Cables
Can you connect the fridge, cooker and dishwasher to the three
corresponding electrical sockets, using cables that don’t go
through the kitchen walls or any of the three appliances, so that
no two cables cross?




                                                        Connect the
                                                        appliances to
                                                        their sockets
                                                        without any
                                                        crossings.

    In ordinary three-dimensional space this puzzle is a bit
artificial, but in two dimensions it’s a genuine problem, as any
inhabitant of Flatland will tell you. A kitchen with no doors is an
even bigger problem, but there you go.
