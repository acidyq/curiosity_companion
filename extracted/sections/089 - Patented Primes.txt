Patented Primes
Because of their importance in encryption algorithms, prime
numbers have commercial significance. In 1994 Roger Schlafly
obtained US Patent 5,373,560 on two primes. The patent states
them as hexadecimal (base-16) numbers, but I’ve converted
them into decimal. They are:

136 // The Poincaré Conjecture



The Poincaré Conjecture
Towards the end of the nineteenth century, mathematicians
succeeded in finding all possible ‘topological types’ of surfaces.
Two surfaces have the same topological type if one of them can
be continuously deformed into the other. Imagine that the
surface is made from flexible dough. You can stretch it, squeeze
it, twist it – but you can’t tear it, or squash different bits
together.
     To keep the story simple, I’ll assume that the surface has no
boundary, that it’s orientable (two-sided, unlike the Möbius
band) and that it’s of finite extent. The nineteenth-century
mathematicians proved that every such surface is topologically
equivalent to a sphere, a torus, a torus with two holes, a torus
with three holes, and so on.




            Sphere.               Torus.         Two-holed torus.

    ‘Surface’ here really does refer only to the surface. A
topologist’s sphere is like a balloon – an infinitely thin sheet of
rubber. A torus is shaped like an inner tube for a tyre (for those of
you who know what an inner tube is). So the ‘dough’ I just
mentioned is really a very thin sheet, not a solid lump.
Topologists call a solid sphere a ‘ball’.
    To achieve their classification of all surfaces, the topologists
had to characterise them ‘intrinsically’, without reference to
any surrounding space. Think of an ant living on the surface,
ignorant of any surrounding space. How can it work out which
surface it inhabits? By 1900 it was understood that a good way
to answer such questions is to think about closed loops in the
surface, and how these loops can be deformed. For example, on
                                   The Poincaré Conjecture // 137



a sphere (by which I mean just the surface, not the solid
interior) any closed loop can be continuously deformed to a
point – ‘shrunk’. For example, the circle running round the
equator can be gradually moved towards the south pole,
becoming smaller and smaller until it coincides with the pole
itself:




                                            How to shrink a loop on
                                            a sphere continuously to
                                            a point.

    In contrast, every surface that is not equivalent to a sphere
contains loops, which cannot be deformed to points. Such loops
‘pass through a hole’, and the hole prevents them from being
shrunk. So the sphere can be characterised as the only surface on
which any closed loop can be shrunk to a point.
    Observe, however, that the ‘hole’ that we see in a picture is
not actually part of the surface. By definition, it’s a place where
the surface isn’t. If we think intrinsically, we can’t talk sensibly
about holes if we try to visualise them in the usual manner. The
ant who lives on the surface and knows no other universe can’t
see that his torus has a dirty great hole in it – any more than we
can look along a fourth dimension. So although I’m using the
word ‘hole’ to explain why the loop can’t be shrunk, a
topological proof runs along different lines.
138 // The Poincaré Conjecture




                                                        On all other
                                                        surfaces, loops
                                                        can get stuck.

     In 1904 Henri Poincaré was trying to take the next step, and
understand ‘manifolds’– three-dimensional analogues of surfaces
– and for a time he assumed that the characterisation of a sphere
in terms of shrinking loops is also true in three dimensions,
where there is a natural analogue of the sphere called the
3-sphere. A 3-sphere is not just a solid ball, but it can be visualised
– if that’s the word – by taking a solid ball and pretending that its
entire surface is actually just a single point.
     Imagine doing the same with a circular disc. The rim closes up
like the top of a bag as you draw a string tight round its edge, and
the result is topologically a sphere. Now go up a dimension . . .




                                                        Turning a disc
                                                        into a sphere.

    At first, Poincaré thought that this characterisation of the
3-sphere should be obvious, or at least easily proved, but later he
realised that one plausible version of this statement is actually
wrong, while another closely related formulation seemed
difficult to prove but might well be true. He posed a deceptively
simple question: if a three-dimensional manifold (without
boundary, of finite extent, and so on) had the property that any
loop in it can be shrunk to a point, must that manifold be
topologically equivalent to the 3-sphere?
    Subsequent attempts to answer this question failed dismally,
                                   The Poincaré Conjecture // 139



although after a huge effort by the world’s topologists, the
answer has proved to be ‘yes’ for all versions in every dimension
higher than 3. The belief that the same answer applies in three
dimensions became known as the Poincaré Conjecture, famous as
one of the eight Millennium Prize Problems (page 127).
     In 2002 a Russian-born mathematician, Grigori Perelman,
caused a sensation by placing several papers on arXiv.org, an
informal website for current research in physics and mathe-
matics. His papers were ostensibly about various properties of the
‘Ricci flow’, but it became clear that if the work was correct, it
implied that the Poincaré Conjecture is also correct. The idea of
using the Ricci flow dates to 1982, when Richard Hamilton
introduced a new technique based on mathematical ideas used
by Albert Einstein in general relativity. According to Einstein,
spacetime can be considered as curved, and the curvature
describes the force of gravity. Curvature is measured by some-
thing called the ‘curvature tensor’, and this has a simpler relative
known as the ‘Ricci tensor’ after its inventor, Gregorio Ricci-
Curbastro.
     According to general relativity, gravitational fields can
change the geometry of the universe as time passes, and these
changes are governed by the Einstein equations, which say that
the stress tensor is proportional to the curvature. In effect, the
gravitational bending of the universe tries to smooth itself out as
time passes, and the Einstein equations quantify that idea.
     The same game can be played using the Ricci version of
curvature, and it leads to the same kind of behaviour: a surface
that obeys the equations for the Ricci flow will naturally tend to
simplify its own geometry by redistributing its curvature more
evenly. Hamilton showed that the familiar two-dimensional
version of the Poincaré Conjecture, characterising the sphere,
can be proved using the Ricci flow. Basically, a surface in which
all loops shrink simplifies itself so much as it follows the Ricci
flow that it ends up being a perfect sphere. Hamilton suggested
generalising this approach to three dimensions, but he hit some
difficult obstacles.
140 // Hippopotamian Logic



     The main complication in three dimensions is that ‘singula-
rities’ can develop, where the manifold pinches together and the
flow breaks down. Perelman’s new idea was to cut the surface
apart near such a singularity, cap off the resulting holes, and
then allow the flow to continue. If the manifold manages to
simplify itself completely after only finitely many singularities
have arisen, then not only is the Poincaré Conjecture true, but a
more far-reaching result, the Thurston Geometrisation
Conjecture, is also true. And that tells us about all possible three-
dimensional manifolds.
     Now the story takes a curious turn. It is generally accepted
that Perelman’s work is correct, although his arXiv papers leave a
lot of gaps that have to be filled in correctly, and that has turned
out to be quite difficult. Perelman had his own reasons for not
wanting the prize – indeed, any reward save the solution itself –
and decided not to expand his papers into something suitable for
publication, although he was generally willing to explain how to
fill in various details if anyone asked him. Experts in the area
were forced to develop their own versions of his ideas.
     Perelman was also awarded a Fields Medal at the Madrid
International Congress of Mathematicians in 2006, the top prize
