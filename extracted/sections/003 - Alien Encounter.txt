Alien Encounter
The starship Indefensible was in orbit around the planet
Noncomposmentis, and Captain Quirk and Mr Crock had
beamed down to the surface.
    ‘According to the Good Galaxy Guide, there are two species of
intelligent aliens on this planet,’ said Quirk.
    ‘Correct, Captain – Veracitors and Gibberish. They all speak
Galaxic, and they can be distinguished by how they answer
questions. The Veracitors always reply truthfully, and the
Gibberish always lie.’
    ‘But physically—’
    ‘—they are indistinguishable, Captain.’
    Quirk heard a sound, and turned to find three aliens creeping
up on them. They looked identical.
    ‘Welcome to Noncomposmentis,’ said one of the aliens.
    ‘I thank you. My name is Quirk. Now, you are . . . ’ Quirk
paused. ‘No point in asking their names,’ he muttered. ‘For all we
know, they’ll be wrong.’
    ‘That is logical, Captain,’ said Crock.
    ‘Because we are poor speakers of Galaxic,’ Quirk improvised,
‘I hope you will not mind if I call you Alfy, Betty and Gemma.’ As
he spoke, he pointed to each of them in turn. Then he turned to
Crock and whispered, ‘Not that we know what sex they are,
either.’
    ‘They are all hermandrofemigynes,’ said Crock.
    ‘Whatever. Now, Alfy: to which species does Betty belong?’
    ‘Gibberish.’
    ‘Ah. Betty: do Alfy and Gemma belong to different species?’
    ‘No.’
    ‘Right . . . Talkative lot, aren’t they? Um . . . Gemma: to
which species does Betty belong?’
    ‘Veracitor.’
    Quirk nodded knowledgeably. ‘Right, that’s settled it, then!’
    ‘Settled what, Captain?’
    ‘Which species each belongs to.’
                                                Tap-an-Animal // 5



   ‘I see. And those species are—?’
   ‘Haven’t the foggiest idea, Crock. You’re the one who’s
supposed to be logical!’
