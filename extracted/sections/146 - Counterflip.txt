Counterflip
Make some circular counters out of card, each black on one side
and white on the other (the precise number doesn’t matter, but
10 or 12 is about right). Arrange them in a row, with a random
choice of colours facing upwards.
    Your task is now to remove all the counters, by making a
series of moves. Each move involves choosing a black counter,
removing it, and flipping any neighbouring counters over to
change their colours. Counters are ‘neighbours’ if they are next
to each other in the original row of counters; removing any
counter creates a gap. As the game progresses, a counter may
have two, one or no neighbours.
    Here is a sample game in which the player succeeds in
removing all the counters:




                                                Sample game
                                                of counterflip.
                                                Lines show
                                                neighbours.

    The key to this puzzle is simple, but far from obvious: with
correct play, you can always succeed if the initial number of
black counters is odd. If it is even, there is no solution.
    You can play the game for fun, without analysing its
mathematical structure. If you feel ambitious, you can look for a
winning strategy – and explain why there is no way to win when
the initial number of black counters is even.
