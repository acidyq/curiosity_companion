Mathematical Theology
It is said that during Leonhard Euler’s second stint at the Court of
Catherine the Great, the French philosopher Denis Diderot was
trying to convert the Court to atheism. Since royalty generally
claims to have been appointed by God, this didn’t go down
terribly well. At any rate, Catherine asked Euler to put a spoke in
Diderot’s wheel. So Euler told the Court that he knew an algebraic
proof of the existence of God. Facing Diderot, he declaimed: ‘Sir,
                                   Mathematical Theology // 247



a þ bn =n ¼ x, hence God exists – reply!’ Diderot had no answer,
and left the Court to widespread laughter, humiliated.
    Yes, well . . . There are some little problems with this
anecdote, which seems to have originated with the English
mathematician Augustus De Morgan in his Budget of Paradoxes.
As the historian Dirk Struik pointed out in 1967, Diderot was an
accomplished mathematician who had published work on
geometry and probability, and would have been able to recognise
nonsense when he heard it. Euler, an even better mathematician,
would not have expected something that simple-minded to
work. The formula is a meaningless equation unless we know
what a, b, n and x are supposed to be. As Struik remarks, ‘No
reason exists to think that the thoughtful Euler would have
behaved in the asinine way indicated.’
    Euler was a religious man, who apparently considered the
Bible to be literal truth, but he also believed that knowledge
stems, in part, from rational laws. In the eighteenth century
there was occasional talk about the possibility of an algebraic
proof of the Deity’s existence, and Voltaire mentions one by
Maupertuis in his Diatribe.
    A much better attempt was found among Kurt Gödel’s
unpublished papers. Naturally, it is formulated in terms of
mathematical logic, and for the record here it is in its entirety:
       Ax:1   &Vx½fðxÞ ! cðxÞ6PðfÞ ! PðcÞ
       Ax:2   Pð:fÞp:PðfÞ
       Th:1   PðfÞ ! }9x½fðxÞ
       Df:1   GðxÞ , Vf½PðfÞ ! fðxÞ
       Ax:3   PðGÞ
       Th:2   }9xGðxÞ
       Df:2   f ess x , fðxÞ6VCCðxÞ ! &Vx½fðxÞ ! CðxÞ
       Ax:4   PðfÞ ! &PðfÞ
       Th:3   GðxÞ ! G ess x
       Df:3   EðxÞ , Vf½f ess x ! &9xfðxÞ
       Ax:5   PðEÞ
       Th:4   &9xGðxÞ

The symbolism belongs to a branch of mathematical logic called
modal logic. Roughly speaking, the proof works with ‘positive
248 // Mathematical Theology



properties’, denoted by P. The expression PðfÞ means that f is a
positive property. The property ‘being God’ is defined (Df.1) by
requiring God to have all positive properties. Here G(x) means
‘x has the property of being God’, which is a fancy way of saying
‘x is God’. The symbols & and } denote ‘necessary truth,’ and
‘contingent truth,’ respectively. The arrow ? means ‘implies’,
V is ‘for all’ and 9 is ‘there exists’. The symbol : means ‘not’, 6 is
‘and’, and $ and , are subtly different versions of ‘if and only
if’. The symbol ‘ess’ is defined in Df.2. The axioms are Ax.1–5.
The theorems (Th.1–4) culminate in the statement ‘there exists x
such that x has the property of being God’ – that is, God exists.
     The distinction between necessary and contingent truth is a
key novelty of modal logic. It distinguishes statements that must
be true (such as ‘2 þ 2 ¼ 4’ in a suitable axiomatic treatment of
mathematics) from those that conceivably might be false (such
as ‘it is raining today’). In conventional mathematical logic, the
statement ‘If A then B’ is always considered to be true when A is
false. For instance ‘2 þ 2 ¼ 5 implies 1 ¼ 1’ is true, and so is
‘2 þ 2 ¼ 5 implies 1 ¼ 42’. This may seem strange, but it is
possible to prove that 1 = 1 starting from 2 þ 2 ¼ 5, and it is also
possible to prove that 1 = 42 starting from 2 þ 2 ¼ 5. So the
convention makes good sense. Can you find any such proofs?
     If we extend this convention to human activities, then the
statement ‘If Hitler had won World War II then Europe would
now be a single nation’ is trivially true, because Hitler did not win
World War II. But ‘If Hitler had won World War II then pigs
would now have wings’ is also trivially true, for the same reason.
In modal logic, however, it would be sensible to debate the truth
or falsity of the first of these statements, depending on how
history might have changed if the Nazis had won the war. The
second would be false, because pigs don’t have wings.
     Gödel’s sequence of statements turns out to be a formal
version of the ontological argument put forward by St Anselm of
Canterbury in his Proslogion of 1077–78. Defining ‘God’ as ‘the
greatest conceivable entity’, Anselm argued that God is con-
                                    Mathematical Theology // 249



ceivable. But if he is not real, we could conceive of Him being
greater by existing in reality. Therefore, God must be real.
    Aside from deep issues of what we mean by ‘greatest’ and so
forth, there is a basic logical flaw here, one that every
mathematician learns at his mother’s knee. Before we can deduce
any property of some entity or concept from its definition, we
must first prove that something satisfying the definition exists.
Otherwise the definition might be self-contradictory. For
instance, suppose we define n to be ‘the largest whole number’.
Then we can easily prove that n ¼ 1. For if not, n2 > n, contra-
dicting the definition of n. Therefore 1 is the largest whole
number. The flaw is that we cannot use any properties of n until
we know that n exists. As it happens, it doesn’t – but even if it
did, we would have to prove that it did before proceeding with
the deduction.
    In short: in order to prove that God exists by Anselm’s line of
thinking, we must first establish that God exists (by some other
line of reasoning, or else the logic is circular). Of course I’ve
simplified things here, and later philosophers tried to remove the
flaw by being more careful with the logic or the philosophy.
Gödel’s proof is essentially a formal version of one proposed by
Leibniz. Gödel never published his proof because he was worried
that it might be seen as a rigorous demonstration of the existence
of God, whereas he viewed it as a formal statement of Leibniz’s
tacit assumptions, which would help to reveal potential logical
errors. For further analysis see
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del’s_ontological_proof and for a
detailed discussion of modal logic and its use in the proof see

Alien Encounter
Alfy is a Veracitor, whereas Betty and Gemma are Gibberish.
    There are only eight possibilities, so you can try each in turn. But
there’s a quicker way. Betty said that Alfy and Gemma belong to the
same species, but they have given different answers to the same
question, so Betty is Gibberish. Alfy said precisely that, making him a
Veracitor. Gemma said the opposite, so she must be Gibberish.

Curious Calculations
          161 ¼ 1
          11611 ¼ 121
          1116111 ¼ 12;321
          1;11161;111 ¼ 1;234;321
          11;111611;111 ¼ 123;454;321

If you know how to do ‘long multiplication’, you can see why this
striking pattern occurs. For instance,
          1116111 ¼
            11;100 þ
             1;110 þ
               111

We find one ‘1’ in the units column, two in the tens column, three in
the hundreds; then the numbers shrink again, with two in the
thousands and one in the ten thousands. So the answer must be
12,321.
    The pattern does continue – but your calculator may run out of
digits. In fact,
                  111; 1116111;111 ¼ 12;345;654;321
              1;111;11161;111;111 ¼ 1;234;567;654;321
            11;111;111611;111;111 ¼ 123;456;787;654;321
          111;111;1116111;111;111 ¼ 12;, 345; 678 ; 987;654;321

After this the pattern breaks down, because digits ‘carry’ and spoil it.

        142;85762 ¼ 285;714
        142;85763 ¼ 428;571
        142;85764 ¼ 571;428
        142;85765 ¼ 714;285
        142;85766 ¼ 857;142
        142;85767 ¼ 999;999

When we multiply 142,857 by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, we get the same
sequence of digits in cyclic order, but starting at a different place. The
999,999 is a bonus.
    This curious fact is not an accident. Basically, it happens because
1/7 in decimals is 0.142 857 142 857 . . . , repeating for ever.

Turnip for the Books
Hogswill started with 400 turnips.

    The way to solve this kind of puzzle is to work backwards.

Suppose that at the start of hour 4, Hogswill has x turnips. By the end
                          6x 1
of the hour he has sold     þ turnips, and since none are left, this
                           7 7
                 6x 1 x  1
equals x. So x  þ ¼            ¼ 0, and x = 1. Similarly, if he had x
                  7 7       7
                                      x1
turnips at the start of hour 3, then       ¼ 1, so x = 8. If he had x
                                     x71
turnips at the start of hour 2, then      ¼ 8, so x = 57. Finally, if he
                                       7
                                            x1
had x turnips at the start of hour 1, then        ¼ 57, so x = 400.

The Four-Colour Theorem
Here are the four counties for which each is adjacent to all of the
others. The middle one is West Midlands – which coincidentally is
where I live – and the three surrounding it are Staffordshire,
Warwickshire and Worcestershire, clockwise from the top.




                                     These counties imply that we
                                     need at least four colours.



Shaggy Dog Story
First, the dodgy arithmetic. The method ‘works’ because the will’s
terms are inconsistent. The fractions do not add up to 1. In fact,
       1 1 1 17
        þ þ ¼
       2 3 9 18
which should make the trick obvious.
   Whoever first designed this puzzle was clever – there are very few
numbers that work, and this choice disguises the inconsistency very
neatly. I mean, how would you feel about a puzzle where the uncle
has 1,129 dogs, the sons are bequeathed 47, 11
                                             3      2
                                               and 15 of them, and
Lunchalot rides to the rescue with 26 extra dogs?
   However, there is another neat possibility: exactly the same,
except that the third son gets one-seventh of the dogs. If the same
trick works, how many dogs were there?
                      Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 255



Answer to the Answer
The clue is that

         1 1 1 41
          þ þ ¼
         2 3 7 42
So there were 41 dogs.

Answer Continued
Oops, I nearly forgot the actual question: what did Gingerbere say to
Ethelfred that so offended Sir Lunchalot?
    It was this: ‘Surely you wouldn’t send a knight out on a dog like
this?’
    I said it was a shaggy dog story.

Confession
The shaggy dog story is inspired, in part, by the science fiction short
story ‘Fall of knight’ by A. Bertram Chandler, which appeared in
Fantastic Universe magazine in 1958.


Rabbits in the Hat
Nothing is wrong with the calculation, but its interpretation is
nonsense. When the various probabilities are combined, we are
working out the probability of extracting a black rabbit, over all
possible combinations of rabbits. It is fallacious to imagine that this
probability is valid for any specific combination. The fallacy is glaring
if there is only one rabbit in the hat. With one rabbit, a similar
argument (ignoring adding and removing a black rabbit, which
changes nothing essential) goes like this: the hat contains either B or
W, each with probability 12. The probability of extracting a black
rabbit is therefore

         1     1
           61 þ 60
         2     2
which is 12. Therefore (really?) half the rabbits in the hat are black, and
half are white.
    But there’s only one rabbit in the hat . . .

River Crossing 1 – Farm Produce
There are two solutions. One is:

(1) Take the goat across.

(2) Come back with no cargo, pick up the wolf, and take that
across.

(3) Bring the goat back, but leave the wolf.

(4) Drop off the goat, pick up the cabbage, cross the river, leave
the cabbage.

(5) Come back with no cargo, pick up the goat, take it across.

In the other, the roles of wolf and cabbage are exchanged.
   I like to solve this geometrically, using a picture in wolf–goat–
cabbage space. This consists of triples (w, g, c) where each symbol is
either 0 (on this side of the river) or 1 (on the far side). So, for
instance, (1, 0, 1) means that the wolf and cabbage are on the far side
but the goat is on this side. The problem is to get from (0, 0, 0) to
(1, 1, 1) without anything being eaten. We don’t need to say where
the farmer is, since he always travels in the boat during river
crossings.




                                               Wolf–goat–cabbage
                                               space: now it’s obvious.


   There are eight possible triples, and they can be thought of as the
vertices of a cube. Because only one item can accompany the farmer
on each trip, the permissible moves are the edges of the cube.
                      Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 257



However, four edges (shown in grey) are not permitted, because
things get eaten. The remaining edges (black) do not cause mayhem.
    So the puzzle reduces to a geometric one: find a route along the
black edges, from (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1). The two solutions are
immediately evident.


More Curious Calculations
(1) 1361167 ¼ 1;001, and this is why the trick works. If you
multiply a three-digit number abc by 1,001 the result is abcabc.
Why? Well, multiplying by 1,000 gives abc000. Then you add a
final abc to multiply by 1,001.

(2) For four-digit numbers, everything is similar, but we have to
multiply by 10,001. This can be done in two stages – multiply by
73 and then by 137 – because 736137 ¼ 10;001.

(3) For five-digit numbers we have to multiply by 100,001. This
can be done in two stages – multiply by 11 and then by 9,091 –
because 1169;091 ¼ 100;001. As a party trick, this is a bit
contrived, though.

(4) We get 471,471,471,471 – the same three digits repeated four
times. Why? Because
        7611613610169;901 ¼ 1;001;001;001

(5) Adding the final 128 leads to 128,000,000 – a million times
the original number. This trick works for all three-digit numbers,
and it does so because
        3636367611613637 ¼ 999;999

Add 1 and you get a million.
    You can turn all these tricks into party magic tricks. For instance,
the trick that turns 471,471 into 471 could be presented like this. The
magician, with eyes blindfolded, asks a member of the audience to
write down a three-digit number (say 471) on a blackboard or a sheet
of paper. A second person then writes it down twice (471,471). A
third, armed with a calculator, divides that by 13 (getting 36,267). A
fourth divides the result by 11 (getting 3,297). While this is going on,
258 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



the magician makes a lot of fuss about how unlikely it is that either of
these numbers divides without remainder. Then she asks what the
final result is, and instantly announces that the original number was
471.
   To work this out, she mentally divides 3,297 by 7. OK, you have
to be able to do that, but if you know your seven times table it’s easy.

    An interesting challenge is to prove that the result really is a

I’ll leave that for anyone who is interested.

(1) If you and your partner hold all the spades, your opponents

case.

(2) Three. You took three, so that’s how many you have.

(3) Zero. If five are in the right envelope, so is the sixth.

Knight’s Tours
There is no closed tour on the 565 square. Imagine colouring the
squares black and white in the usual chessboard fashion. Then the
knight changes colour at each move. A closed tour must then have
equal numbers of black and white squares. But 565 ¼ 25 is odd. The
same argument rules out closed tours on all squares with odd sides.
    There is no tour on the 4 6 4 square. The main obstacle is that
each corner square connects to only two other squares, and the
diagonally opposite corner also connects to those two squares. A little
thought proves that if a tour of all 16 squares exists, it must start at
one corner and finish in an adjacent corner. Systematic consideration
of possibilities shows that this is impossible.
    However, there is a tour that visits 15 of the 16 squares (showing
that the situation regarding a complete tour is delicate):




                                        How the knight
                                        can visit 15 squares.



White-Tailed Cats
Suppose that there are c cats, of which w have white tails. There are c
(c1) ordered pairs of distinct cats, and w(w1) ordered pairs of
white-tailed cats. (You can choose the first cat of the pair in c ways,
but the second in only c1 ways since you’ve used up one cat. Ditto
for white-tailed cats. By ‘ordered’ I mean that choosing first cat A and
260 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



then cat B is considered to be different from B first and then A. If you
don’t like that, then both formulas have to be halved – with the same
result.)
    This means that the probability of both cats having white tails is

           wðw  1Þ
           cðc  1Þ

and this must be 12. Therefore

           cðc  1Þ ¼ 2wðw  1Þ

with c and w whole numbers. The smallest solution is c ¼ 4,
w ¼ 3. The next smallest turns out to be c ¼ 21, w ¼ 15. Since Ms
Smith has fewer than 20 cats, she must have four cats, of which three
have white tails.


Perpetual Calendar
Each cube must include 1 and 2 so that 11 and 22 can be represented.
If only one cube bears a 0, then at most six of the nine numbers 01–
09 can be represented, so both must bear a 0 as well. That leaves six
spare faces for the seven digits 3–9, so the puzzle looks impossible . . .
until you realise that the cube bearing the number 6 can be turned
upside down to represent 9. So the white cube bears the numbers 0, 1,
2, 6 (also 9), 7 and 8, and the grey cube bears the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
and 5. (Note that I’ve shown a 5 on my grey cube, and that tells us
which cube is which.)


Deceptive Dice
There is no best dice. If Innumeratus plays, and Mathophila chooses
correctly (as she will, because she’s like that), then he will lose, in the
long run. The odds will always favour Mathophila.
    How come? Mathophila has constructed her dice so that on
average, the yellow one beats the red one, the red one beats the blue
one – and the blue one beats the yellow one! At first sight this seems
impossible, so let me explain why it’s true.
    Each number occurs twice on each of the dice, so the chance of
rolling any particular number is always 13. So I can make a table of the
                                                 Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 261



possibilities, and see who wins for which combinations of numbers
thrown. Each combination has the same probability, 19.

Here blue wins five times out of nine, yellow wins only four times.
         So yellow beats red 59 of the time, red beats blue 59 of the time, and
blue beats yellow 59 of the time.
         This gives Mathophila an advantage if she chooses second, which
she has cunningly arranged. If Innumeratus chooses the red dice, she
should choose yellow. If he chooses the yellow dice, she should
choose blue. And if he chooses the blue dice, she should choose red.
   It may not be a huge advantage – five chances out of nine of
winning, compared with four out of nine – but it’s still an advantage.
262 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



In the long run, Innumeratus will lose his pocket money. If he wants
to play, then a gentlemanly ‘No, you choose’ would be a good idea.
    It may seem impossible to have yellow ‘better than’ red, and red
‘better than’ blue – but not to have yellow ‘better than’ blue. What’s
happening is that the meaning of ‘better than’ depends on which
dice are being used. It’s a bit like three football teams:

. The Reds have a good goalkeeper and a good defence, but a
    poor attack. They win if and only if the opposing goalie is
    poor.
.   The Yellows have a poor goalie, a good defence, and a good
    attack. They win if and only if the opposing defence is poor.
.   The Blues have a good goalie, a poor defence, and a good
    attack. They win if and only if the opposing attack is poor.

Then (check this!) the Reds always beat the Yellows, the Yellows
always beat the Blues, and the Blues always beat the Reds.
   Dice like this are said to be intransitive. (‘Transitive’ means that if
A beats B and B beats C then A beats C. That doesn’t happen here.)
On the practical side, the existence of intransitive dice tells us that
some ‘obvious’ assumptions about economic behaviour are actually
wrong.


An Age-Old Old-Age Problem
Scrumptius was 69. There was no year 0 between BC dates and AD
dates. (If you decided that he might be 68 if he died earlier in the day
than he was born, you get a point for ingenuity. But you lose two for
pedantry, because it is usual to increase a person’s age by one year as
soon as their birthday begins, immediately after midnight.)


Heron Suit
The deduction is incorrect. Consider a cat with blunt claws that plays
with a gorilla, does not wear a heron suit, has a tail, has no whiskers
and is unsociable. The first five statements are all true, but the sixth is
not.
    I’d explain about the heron suit, but my cat has refused
permission on the grounds that it might incriminate itself.

Euler’s Pentagonal Holiday
Here’s a solution to (b), which is automatically a solution to (a) as
well. There are others. But they all have to start and end at the two
vertices with valency 3, and a mirror-symmetric one must always
have the bottom edge of the pentagon in the middle of the tour.

Ouroborean Rings
One possible ouroborean ring for quadruplets is

       1111000010100110

There are others. The topic has a long history, going back to Irving
Good in 1946. Ouroborean rings exist for all m-tuples of n digits: for
example, in this one

       000111222121102202101201002

each triple of the three digits 0, 1, 2 occurs exactly once.
   How many ouroborean rings are there? In 1946 Nicholas de
Bruijn proved that for m-tuples formed from the two digits 0 and 1,
                 m1
                       m
this number is 22           , which grows extremely fast. Here rings
obtained by rotating a given one are considered to be the same.

The Ourotorus
There is a unique solution, except for various symmetry transfor-
mations – rotation, reflection and translations horizontally or
vertically. Bear in mind the ‘wrap round’ convention. So you can, for
instance, cut off the four pieces on the right and move them to the
left.




                                                                                            Solution to the

A Constant Bore
The only reason for including this kind of question in this kind of
book is if something surprising happens, and the only surprising
thing that makes much sense is that the answer does not depend on
the radius of the sphere.
         That sounds crazy – suppose the sphere were the Earth? But to
make the hole only 1 metre long, you have to remove almost the
entire planet, leaving only a very thin band round the equator, one
metre wide. So just maybe . . .
         Here comes the easy bit. Assuming that the radius really does not
                          Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 265



matter, we can work out the answer by considering the special case
when the hole is very narrow – in fact, when its width is zero.




                                             Special case of the
                                             problem.

    Now the volume of copper is equal to that of the entire sphere,
and the diameter of the sphere is 1 metre. So its radius is r ¼ 12, and its
volume is given by the famous formula

           4
        V ¼ pr3
           3
which equals p=6 when r ¼ 12.
    Ah, but how do we know that the answer doesn’t depend on the
radius? That’s a bit more complicated, and it uses more geometry. (Or
you can do it by calculus, if you know how.)




                                           Restoring the spherical caps
                                           to help the calculation.



    Put back the missing ‘spherical caps’ on the top and bottom.
Suppose that the radius of the sphere is r, and the radius of the
cylindrical hole is a. Then Pythagoras’s Theorem applied to the small
triangle at the top right tells us that

        r2 ¼ a2 þ ð12Þ2
266 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



so

         a2 ¼ r2  14 :

Now we need three volume formulas:

. The volume of a sphere of radius r is 43 pr3 .
. The volume of a cylinder of base radius a and height h is pa2 h.
. The volume of a spherical cap of height k in a sphere of radius
     r is 13 pk2 ð3r  kÞ.

Don’t worry, I had to look that last one up myself.
     The volume of copper required is the volume of the sphere,
minus that of the cylinder, minus that of two spherical caps, which is

         3pr  pa h  3pk ð3r  kÞ
         4 3     2    2  2


since there are two spherical caps. But h ¼ 1; k ¼ r  12 and a2 ¼ r2  14,
so the volume is
                                          2   
         3pr  p r  4            23p r  12 3r  12
         4 3      2  1


Doing the algebra, almost everything miraculously cancels, and all
that remains is p=6.

Ernest Dudeney, and can be found in his book Amusements in
Mathematics. There are lots of answers if you use four or more
arithmetical symbols.

Ring a-Ring a-Ringroad
The difference is 20p metres, or roughly 63 metres, for roads on the
flat. It doesn’t depend on the length of the motorway, or how wiggly
it is, provided the curvature is gradual enough for ‘10 metres distance
between lanes’ to be unambiguous.
268 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet




                                   Data for a
                                   circular M25.

   Let’s start with an idealised version, where the M25 is a perfect
circle. If the anticlockwise lane has radius r, then the clockwise one
has radius r þ 10. Their circumferences are then 2pr and 2pðr þ 10Þ.
The difference is

       2pðr þ 10Þ  2pr ¼ 20p

which is independent of r.




                                                   A rectangular
                                                   motorway also creates
                                                   an excess
                                                   of 20.
   However, the M25 is not circular. For argument’s sake, try a
rectangle. Now the outer lane consists of four straight bits, which
match the inner lane exactly, plus four quarter-circles at the corners.
These extra arcs fit together to make a single circle of radius 10.
Again, we get an excess of exactly 20p.




                                     A non-convex polygon
                                     gives 20p as well.
    The same point holds for any ‘polygonal’ road – one composed of
straight lines, plus arcs of circles at corners. The straight-line parts
                      Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 269



match; the arcs add up to one complete circle of radius 10. This is true
even when the polygon is not convex, such as the M-shape shown
above.* Now the outer lane has arcs that add up to one and a quarter
circles, and the inner lane has a quarter circle of its own. But this
quarter-turn is of opposite curvature, so it cancels out the excess
quarter-turn in the outer lane. The point is that any sufficiently
smooth curve can be approximated as closely as we wish by polygons,
so the excess is 20p in all cases.
    The same argument applies to runners on a curved track. In the
400 metres, runners start from ‘staggered’ positions, to make the
overall distance the same in each lane. The stagger between adjacent
lanes must be 2p times the width of a lane. This width is usually 1.22
metres, so the stagger should be 7.66 metres per lane – provided it is
applied on a straight section of the track. In practice the region where
the athletes start often includes part of a bend, so the numbers are a
bit different. The easy way to calculate them is to make sure that each
runner goes exactly
400 metres, which is what the rules actually state.


Magic Hexagon
The only solution (apart from rotations and reflections of it) is




                                          The only non-trivial magic
                                          hexagon.


    This magic hexagon was found independently by several people


*   It’s not true if the polygon crosses itself, as does the Suzuka racing
    circuit in Japan. But for some reason figure-of-eight orbital
    motorways don’t seem to have caught on.
270 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



between 1887 and 1958. If we try similar patterns of hexagons with n
cells along the edge instead of 3, then the only other case where a
magic hexagon (using consecutive numbers 1, . . . , n) exists is the
trivial pattern when n ¼ 1: a single hexagon containing the number
1. Charles W. Trigg explained why in 1964, by proving that the magic
constant must be

       9ðn4  2n3 þ 2n2  nÞ þ 2
               2ð2n  1Þ

which is an integer only when n ¼ 1 or 3.


Pentalpha
The star shape is designed to mislead. The important aspect of the
structure is which circles are two steps away from which, because
these are where each new counter starts and finishes. By focusing on
this we can draw a much simpler diagram:


                                       A transformed version of the
                                       puzzle.




   The rule for placing counters is now: place each new counter on
an empty circle and slide it to an adjacent empty circle. It is now
obvious how to cover nine circles. For example, place a counter on 1
and slide it to 0. Then place a counter on 2 and slide it to 1. Then
place a counter on 3 and slide it to 2. Continue in this way, placing
each new counter two empty dots away from the existing string of
counters.
   Copy these moves on the original diagram to solve the puzzle.
   In the second diagram, you can add new counters at either end,
so there are lots of solutions. But you can’t create more than one
connected chain of counters at any stage, because there are then at
                     Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 271



least two gaps where no counters exist, and each gap leads to at least
one circle that can’t be covered.

Curves of Constant Width
Surprisingly, the circle isn’t the only curve of constant width. The
simplest curve of constant width that is not a circle is an equilateral
triangle with rounded edges:




                                                     (Left) Constant-

                                                     pence coin.

   Each edge is an arc of a circle, with centre at the opposite vertex.
Two British coins, the 20p and 50p, are 7-sided curves of constant
width; this shape was chosen because it makes the coins suitable for
use in slot machines, but distinguishes them from other circular
coins worth different amounts – which is especially useful for the
visually impaired.


Connecting Cables
The main point is not to connect the dishwasher first, with a straight

makes a solution impossible. If you connect the fridge and cooker
first, it’s then obvious how to hook up the dishwasher.

Compensating Errors
The numbers were 1, 2 and 3. Then 1 þ 2 þ 3 ¼ 6 ¼ 16263. This is
the only solution for three positive whole numbers.
   With two numbers, the only possibility is 2 þ 2 ¼ 4 ¼ 262. With
four numbers, the only solution is 1 þ 1 þ 2 þ 4 ¼ 8 ¼ 16 16264.
   With more numbers, there are usually lots of solutions, but in
some exceptional cases there is just one solution. If the sum of k
positive whole numbers is equal to their product, and only one set of
k numbers has that property, then k is one of the numbers 2, 3, 4, 6,
24, 114, 174 and 444, or it is at least 13, 587, 782, 064. No examples
greater than that are known, but their possible existence remains
open.

Wherefore Art Thou Borromeo?
In the second pattern, the two lower rings are linked. In the third
pattern, all three pairs are linked. In the fourth pattern, the top ring is
linked to the left one which in turn is linked to the right one.
         There are lots of four-ring versions. Here’s one:




                                                                                     A set of four

         Analogous arrangements exist for any finite number of rings. It
has been proved that the Borromean property can’t be obtained using
                        Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 275



perfectly circular (and therefore flat) rings. This is a topological
phenomenon.


Percentage Play
The profit and loss do not cancel out. The bicycle he sold to Bettany
cost him £400 (he lost £100, which is 25% of £400). The one he sold
to Gemma cost him £240 (he gained £60, which is 25% of £240).
Overall, he paid £640 and received £600, so he lost £40.

Spelling Mistakes
There are four spelling mistakes, in the words ‘there’, ‘mistakes’, ‘in’

    But . . . this means that if the sentence is true, it has to be false,
but if it’s false, it has to be true. Oops.


Expanding Universe
Perhaps surprisingly, the Indefensible actually does get to the edge of
the universe . . . but it takes about 10434 years to do so. By then the
universe has grown to a radius of about 10437 light years.
    Let’s see why.
    At each stage, when the universe expands, the fraction of the
distance that the Indefensible has already covered doesn’t change.
That suggests that if we think about the fractions, we ought to be able
to find the answer more easily.
    In the first year the ship travels 1/1,000 of the distance to the
edge. In the next year it travels 1/2,000 of the distance. In the third
year it travels 1/3,000 of the distance, and so on. In the nth year it
travels 1/1,000n of the distance. So the total fraction travelled after n
years is
                                   
             1        1 1 1        1      1
                   1 þ þ þ þ ... þ    ¼       Hn
           1;000      2 3 4        n    1;000

which is why harmonic numbers are relevant. In particular, the
number of years required to reach the edge is whatever value of n first
makes this fraction bigger than 1 – that is, makes Hn bigger than
1,000. There is no known formula for the value of Hn in terms of n,
and it grows very slowly as n increases. However, it can be proved
that by making n large enough, Hn can be made as large as we wish –
and in particular, greater than 1. So the Indefensible does get to the
edge if n is sufficiently large.
    To find out how large, we use the hint. To make Hn > 1,000 we
require log n þ g > 1;000, so that n > e1;000g . So the number of years
required to reach the edge of the universe is very close to e999:423 ,
which is 10434 in round numbers. By then the universe will have
grown to n þ 1 thousand light years, which is near enough 10437 light
years.
    Initially the remaining distance keeps increasing each year, but
eventually the ship starts to catch up with the expanding edge of the
universe. Its ‘share’ of the expansion grows as it gets farther out, and
                     Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 277



in the long run this beats the fixed expansion rate of 1,000 light years
per year of the edge of the universe. The ‘long run’ here is very long:
it takes about e999g ¼ 10433:61 years before the remaining distance
starts to decrease – roughly the first third of the voyage.

Don’t Let Go!
Your body plus the rope forms a closed loop. It is a topological
theorem that a knot cannot be created in a closed loop by deforming
it continuously, so the problem can never be solved if you pick up the
rope in the obvious ‘normal’ way. Instead, you must first tie a knot in
your arms. This may sound difficult, but anyone can do it: just fold
them across your chest. Now lean forward so that the hand that is on
top of an arm can reach over the arm to pick up one end of the rope,
and pick up the other end with the other hand. Unfold your arms,
and the knot appears.


Möbius and His Band
If you cut a Möbius band along the middle, it stays in one piece – see
the second limerick. The resulting band has a 3608 twist.
    If you cut a Möbius band one-third of the way across, you get two
linked bands. One is a Möbius band, the other (longer) one has a 3608
twist.
    If you cut a band with a 3608 twist along the middle, you get two
linked bands with 3608 twists.


Three More Quickies

(2) The parrot is deaf.

(3) The usual answer is that one hemisphere of the planet is land,
and the other is water, so the continent and the island are
278 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



identical. But puzzles like this are easily ‘cooked’ by finding
loopholes in the conditions. For instance, maybe Nff lives on the
continent but its house is on the island, and Pff eats houses for
breakfast. Or on Nff-Pff, the land moves – after all, who knows
what happens on an alien world? Or . . .




                                         Nff and Pff on their
                                         home planet of Nff-Pff.



Miles of Tiles
I forgot to add an extra condition: the tiles should meet at their
corners. The corners of some might meet the edges of others. This
doesn’t change the answer, but it complicates the proof a little.

                                             More generally . . .


    It’s simpler to tackle a more general problem, where the lengths
are as shown. By similar triangles,
        xþy y                       xþy x
           ¼            and            ¼
         a   c                       b   c
Adding, we get
                           
                      1 1           xþy
        ðx þ yÞ        þ        ¼
                      a b            c

Dividing by xþy, we obtain

        1 1 1
         þ ¼
        a b c


leading to

               ab
        c¼
              aþb
We notice that c does not depend on x or y, which is a good job since
the puzzle didn’t tell us those. We know that a ¼ 600, and
b ¼ 400, so

              6006400
        c¼            ¼ 240
                1000

Paradox Lost
I don’t think this one stands up to scrutiny. Both litigants are doing a
pick-and-mix – at one moment assuming that the agreement is valid,
280 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



but at another, assuming that the court’s decision can override the
agreement. But why do you take an issue like this to court? Because
the court’s job is to resolve any claimed ambiguities in the contract,
override the contract if need be, and tell you what to do. So if the court
orders the student to pay up, then he has to, and if the court says that
he doesn’t have to pay up, then Protagoras doesn’t have a leg to stand
on.

Hippopotamian Logic
Therefore oak trees grow in Africa.
      Why? Suppose, on the contrary, that oak trees don’t grow in
Africa. Then squirrels hibernate in the winter, and hippos eat acorns.
Therefore I’ll eat my hat. But I won’t eat my hat, a contradiction.
Therefore (reductio ad absurdum) my assumption that oak trees don’t
grow in Africa must be false. So oak trees grow in Africa.


Pig on a Rope




                                         Six copies simplify
                                         the geometry.
                      Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 281



To simplify the problem, make six copies of the field, with six copies
of the (shaded) region accessible to the pig. Then we want the shaded
circle to have half the area of the hexagon. The area of the circle is pr 2
where r is the radius. The hexagon has sides 100 metres long, so its
                 p             p                  p
area is 10;00063 3=2, or 15;000 3. So pr2 ¼ 15;000 3, and
             s       p 
                15;000 3
        r¼
                    p

which is about 90.9392 metres.


The Surprise Examination
I think that the Surprise Examination Paradox is a very interesting
case of something that looks like a paradox but isn’t. My reason is
that there is a logically equivalent statement, which is obviously true
– but totally uninteresting.
    Suppose that every morning the students announce confidently,
‘The test will be today.’ Then eventually they will do so on the day of
the actual test, at which point they will be able to claim that the test
was not a surprise.
    I don’t see any logical objection to this technique, but it’s
obviously a cheat. If you expect something to happen every day, then
of course you won’t be surprised when it does. My view – and I’ve
argued with enough mathematicians who didn’t agree with me, let
alone anybody else, so I’m aware that there’s room for differences of
opinion – is that the paradox is bogus. It is nothing more than this
obvious strategy, dressed up to look mysterious. The cheat is not
entirely obvious, because everything is intuited instead of being
acted upon, but it’s the same cheat.
    Let me sharpen the conditions by requiring the students to state,
each morning before school begins, whether they think the test will
be held that day. With this condition, in order for the students to
know that it can’t be on Friday, they have to leave themselves the
option of announcing on Friday morning that ‘It will be today.’ And
the same goes for Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesday and Monday. So
they have to say ‘It will be today’ five times in all – once per day. This
282 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



makes sense: if the students are allowed to revise their prediction
each day, then eventually they’ll be right.
    If we demand even the tiniest bit more, though, their strategy
falls to bits. For example, suppose that they’re allowed only one such
announcement. If Friday arrives and they haven’t used up their
guess, then they can make the announcement then. But if they have
used up their guess, they’re in trouble. Worse, they can’t wait until
Friday to use their guess, because the test might be on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.
    In fact, if they are allowed four guesses, they’re still sunk. Only if
they are permitted five guesses can they guarantee to predict the
correct day. But any fool could do that.
    I’m proposing two things here. The less interesting one is that the
paradox hinges on what we mean by ‘surprise’. The more interesting
proposal is that whatever we mean by ‘surprise’, there are two
logically equivalent ways to state the students’ prediction strategy.
One – the usual presentation – seems to indicate a genuine paradox.
The other – describe the strategy in terms of actual actions, not
hypothetical ones – turns it into something correct but unsurprising,
destroying the element of paradox.
    Equivalently, we can up the ante by letting the teacher add
another condition. Suppose that the students have poor memories,
so that any work they do on a given evening to prepare for the test is
forgotten by the next evening. If, as the students claim, the test is not
going to be a surprise, then they ought to be able to get away with
very little homework: just wait until the evening before the test, then
cram, pass and forget. But the teacher, in her wisdom, knows that
this won’t work. If they don’t do their homework on Sunday evening,
the test could be on Monday, and if it is, they’ll fail. Ditto Tuesday
through Friday. So despite claiming never to be surprised by the test,
the students have to do five evenings of homework.


Antigravity Cone
The uphill motion is an illusion. As the cone moves in the ‘uphill’
direction, its centre of gravity moves downwards, because the slope
widens out and the cone is supported nearer to its two ends.

                                                  Side view: as the cone

                                                  which points up the
                                                  slope, its centre of
                                                  gravity moves down

What Shape is a Crescent Moon?




                                           Geometry of an
                                           illuminated sphere.

The left curve of the crescent is a semicircle, but the other edge is not
an arc of a circle. It is a ‘semiellipse’ – an ellipse cut in half along its
longest axis. The diagram shows the rays of the Sun, which we are
assuming to be parallel. In this view the Sun must be positioned some
distance behind the plane of the page to create the crescent. The light
and dark portions of the Moon are hemispheres, so the boundary
between them is a circle; in fact, it is where a plane at right angles to
the Sun’s rays cuts the sphere. We observe this circle at an angle. A
circle viewed at an angle is an ellipse – its hidden edge is drawn
dotted, and we see only the front half. (I’ve used grey shading to
show the dark part of the moon.)
    In reality the illumination becomes very faint near the boundary
between light and dark, and the Moon is a bit bumpy. So the shape is
not as clearly defined as this discussion suggests. You can also quibble
about how the circle is projected on to the retina if you so desire.
    The crescent shape formed by two circular arcs can sometimes be
seen in the sky – most dramatically during an eclipse of the Sun,
when the Moon partially overlaps the Sun’s disk. But now it is the
Sun, not the Moon, that looks like a crescent.

A Puzzling Dissection
The area can’t change when the pieces are reassembled in a different
way. When we form the rectangle, the pieces don’t quite fit, and a
long, thin parallelogram is missing – I’ve exaggerated the effect to
show you what I mean.




                                                 Why the area isn’t 65.

    In fact, if we calculate the slopes of the slanting lines, the top-left
line has a slope of 2/5 = 0.4 and the top-right line has a slope of 3/8 =
0.375. These are different, and the first is slightly larger, so the top-
left line is slightly steeper than the top-right one. In particular, they
are not two pieces of the same straight line.
    The key lengths in this puzzle are 5, 8 and 13 – consecutive
Fibonacci numbers (page 98). You can create a similar puzzle using
other sets of consecutive Fibonacci numbers.


Nothing Up My Sleeve . . .
The topological point is that because your jacket has holes,* the
string is not actually linked to your body and the jacket. It just looks


*   Armholes, not moth holes.
                     Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 287



that way. To see that the string is not linked to your body or the
jacket, imagine shrinking your body down to the size of a walnut, so
that it slides down your sleeve and into your pocket. Now you can
obviously pull the loop away, because your wrist is no longer
blocking the gap between sleeve and pocket. However, this method is
impractical, so we need a substitute.




                                                       Here’s how.


    Begin by pulling the end of the loop up the outside of your arm
inside the jacket sleeve, as shown by the arrow in the diagram on the
left. Pull out a loop at the top and draw it over your head to reach the
position shown in the right-hand diagram. Then pull the loop down
the outside of the other arm, inside the sleeve, as shown by the arrow
in the right-hand diagram. Pull it over your hand and then back up
through the sleeve. Now take hold of the string where it passes in
front of your head and push it down inside the front of the jacket.
The string pulls through the jacket armholes, and after a few wiggles
it drops down around your ankles and you can step out of it.


Nothing Down My Leg . . .
After the moves that solve the previous problem, the string ends up
looped around your waist, and it is still looped around your arm. So
you now follow a similar sequence of moves again, with the trousers
instead of the jacket: pass a loop down the trouser leg on the side
opposite the pocket with the hand in it, over the foot, back up the
trouser leg – and finally remove the string down the other trouser leg.
All of this is enormously undignified, and thus highly amusing to
spectators. Topology can be fun.

Two Perpendiculars
Neither Euclidean theorem is wrong. Mine is.
    The mistake is the assumption that P and Q are different points.
In fact, P and Q coincide – this follows from Euclid’s two theorems,
and is highly plausible if you draw an accurate picture.

The smallest number of moves is 15. The path shown, and its
reflection about the diagonal, are the only solutions. (Remember –
each square is visited exactly once; that is, the path cannot cross itself.)


What Day is It?
Today is Saturday. (As I told you right at the start, the conversation
took place yesterday.) Darren’s answers imply that the day of the
conversation is exactly one of Friday, Monday or Thursday. Delia’s
imply that it is Saturday, Sunday or Friday. The only common day is
Friday. So when the conversation took place, it was Friday.


Logical or Not?
The logic is wrong. If the weather is bad, then pigs don’t fly. As a
consequence, we don’t know whether they have wings. So we don’t
know whether to carry an umbrella.
    It may seem strange that a deduction can be illogical when – as
                     Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 289



here – the conclusion is entirely sensible. Actually, this is very
common. For example:

       2 þ 2 ¼ 22 ¼ 262 ¼ 4

is nonsense as far as logic goes, but it gives the right answer. All
mathematicians know that you can give false proofs of correct
statements. What you can’t do – if mathematics is logically
consistent, as we fervently hope – is give correct proofs of false
statements.


A Question of Breeding
We are told that Catt breeds pigs.
   Hamster does not breed pigs, hamsters, dogs or zebras. So he
breeds cats.
   Now, Dogge breeds either hamsters or zebras; Pigge breeds dogs
hamsters or zebras; Zebra breeds either dogs or hamsters. Since the
namesake of Zebra’s animals breeds hamsters, Zebra must breed dogs.
Therefore Dogge breeds hamsters, so Pigge breeds zebras.


Fair Shares
Here’s Steinhaus’s method. Let the three people be Arthur, Belinda
and Charlie.

(1) Arthur cuts the cake into three pieces (which he thinks are all
fair, hence subjectively equal).

(2) Belinda must either
    . pass (if she thinks that at least two pieces are fair) or
    . label two pieces (which she thinks are unfair) as being
        ‘bad’.

(3) If Belinda passed, then Charlie chooses a piece (which he
thinks is fair). Then Belinda chooses a piece (which she thinks is
fair). Finally, Arthur takes the last piece.

(4) If Belinda labelled two pieces as ‘bad’, then Charlie is offered
the same options as Belinda – pass, or label two pieces ‘bad’. He
takes no notice of Belinda’s labels.
290 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



(5) If Charlie did nothing in step 4, then the players choose
pieces in the order Belinda, Charlie, Arthur (using the same
strategy as in step 3.)

(6) Otherwise, both Belinda and Charlie have labelled two pieces
as ‘bad’. There must be at least one piece that they both consider
‘bad’. Arthur takes that one. (He thinks that all the pieces are fair,
so he can’t complain.)

(7) The other two pieces are reassembled into a heap. (Charlie
and Belinda both think that the result is at least two-thirds of the
cake.) Now Charlie and Belinda play I-cut-you-choose on the
heap, to share what’s left between themselves (thereby getting
what they each judge to be a fair share).

The Sixth Deadly Sin
In the early 1960s John Selfridge and John Horton Conway
independently found an envy-free method of cake division for three
players. It goes like this:

(1) Arthur cuts the cake into three pieces, which he considers to
be ‘fair’ – of equal value to him.

(2) Belinda must either
    . pass (if she thinks that two or more pieces are tied for
        largest) or
    . trim (the largest) piece (to make the two the same). Any
        trimmings are called leftovers and set aside.

(3) Charlie, Belinda and Arthur, in that order, choose a piece
(one they think is largest or equal largest). If Belinda did not pass
in step 2, she must choose the trimmed piece unless Charlie
chose it first.

At this stage, the part of the cake other than the leftovers has been
divided into three pieces in an envy-free manner—a ‘partial envy-free
allocation’.

(4) If Belinda passed at step 2, there are no leftovers and we are
                      Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 291



done. If not, either Belinda or Charlie took the trimmed piece.
Call this person the ‘non-cutter’, and the other one of the two
the ‘cutter’. The cutter divides the leftovers into three pieces
(that he/she considers equal).

Arthur has an ‘irrevocable advantage’ over the non-cutter, in the
following sense. The non-cutter received the trimmed piece, and
even if he/she gets all the leftovers, Arthur still thinks that he/she has
no more than a fair share, because he thought that the original pieces
were all fair. So however the leftovers are now divided, Arthur will not
envy the non-cutter.

(5) The three pieces of leftovers are chosen by the players in the
order non-cutter, Arthur, cutter. (Each chooses the largest piece,
or one of the equal largest, among those available.)

The non-cutter chooses from the leftovers first, so has no reason to be
envious. Arthur does not envy the non-cutter because of his
irrevocable advantage; he does not envy the cutter because he
chooses before he/she does. The cutter can’t envy anybody since he/
she was the one who divided the leftovers.
    Recently, Steven Brams, Alan Taylor and others have found very
complicated envy-free methods for any number of people.
    When it comes to sharing cakes, avoiding the second deadly sin*
is more tricky, in my experience.


Weird Arithmetic
The result is correct, though as teacher said, you should cancel 9 from
the top and the bottom to simplify it to 25. But Henry’s presumed
method leaves a lot to be desired.
    For instance,

        3 8 38
         6 ¼
        4 5 45
is wrong.




*   Gluttony.
292 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



    So when does his method work? An easy way to find one more
solution is to turn Henry’s upside down:

         4 5 45
          6 ¼
         1 8 18
But there are other solutions. With the stated limits on the number of
digits, we are trying to solve the equation

         a c 10a þ c
          6 ¼
         b d 10b þ d
which boils down to

         acð10b þ dÞ ¼ bdð10a þ cÞ

where a, b, c and d can each be any digit from 1 to 9 inclusive.
    There are 81 trivial solutions where a ¼ b and c ¼ d. Aside from
these, there are 14 solutions, where (a, b, c, d) ¼ (1, 2, 5, 4), (1, 4, 8, 5),
(1, 6, 4, 3), (1, 6, 6, 4), (1, 9, 9, 5), (2, 1, 4, 5), (2, 6, 6, 5), (4, 1, 5, 8),
(4, 9, 9, 8), (6, 1, 3, 4), (6, 1, 4, 6), (6, 2, 5, 6), (9, 1, 5, 9) and (9, 4, 8, 9).
These form seven pairs (a, b, c, d) and (b, a, d, c), corresponding to
turning the fractions upside down.


How Deep is the Well?
The depth of the well is

         s ¼ 12 gt2 ¼ 12 10ð6Þ2 ¼ 180 metres ¼ 590 feet

which agrees very well with what the Time Team measured (about
550 feet) when you take into account the difficulty of timing the fall
by hand. A more accurate figure for g is 9:8 m s2 , leading to a depth of
176 metres or 577 feet. Presumably the exact time was slightly less
than 6 seconds.
   Yes, the well really was that deep. How did they dig it, so long
ago? The mind boggles.


McMahon’s Squares
The 24 tiles can be assembled as shown. There are 17 other solutions,
plus rotations and reflections.
                      Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 293




                                                 One of the 18 basically
                                                 different solutions.

    One feature of the tiles helps us work out how to assemble them.
Choose a border colour, say grey. There are four tiles that have two
blue triangles opposite each other and no other blue triangles. Their
remaining triangles are grey/grey, black/black, white/white and
black/white. The only way to fit these tiles in is to stack four of them
together across the narrow width of the rectangle:




                                The four tiles like the left-hand
                                one have to stack together.
                                The white triangles can be any
                                combination of black and white.

    There are still lots of ways to proceed, but this observation helps
to restrict the possibilities. There are 18 basically different solutions,
which lead to 216 solutions altogether by swapping colours, rotating
the picture or reflecting it. Note the stack in the third column of the
sample solution above.


Archimedes, You Old Fraud!
Let’s say that Archimedes can exert a force sufficient to lift his own
weight, call it 100 kg. The mass of the Earth is about 661024 kg. To
keep the analysis simple, suppose that the pivot is 1 metre from the
Earth. Then the law of the lever tells us that distance from the pivot
to Archimedes is 661022 metres, and his lever is 1 þ 661022 metres
long – about 1.6 million light years, or about two-thirds of the way to
294 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



the Andromeda Galaxy. If Archimedes now moves his end of the
lever one metre, the Earth moves 1=ð661022 Þ ¼ 1:6661023 metres.
    Now, a proton has a diameter of 1015 metres—
    Yes, but it still moves, dammit!
    True. But suppose that instead of using this huge and improbable
apparatus, Archimedes stands on the surface of the Earth and jumps.
For every metre he goes up, the Earth moves 1:6661023 metres down
(action/reaction). Jumping has exactly the same effect as his
hypothetical lever. So the place to stand is on the Earth – but you
don’t stand still.


The Missing Symbol
Well, the symbols þ; ; 6; and7 don’t work, because 4 þ 5 and 465
are too big, and 4  5 and 475 are too small. Neither does the square
          p             p
root sign , because 4 5 ¼ 8:94 and that’s too big as well.
    Give up? How about the decimal point, 4.5?


Where There’s a Wall, There’s a Way

                                                      the wall.

    Rotation and reflection yield three other solutions. The compo-
nent shapes are called tetrahexes.


Connecting Utilities
No, you can’t. As stated – and without ‘cooking’ the puzzle by, say,
working on a surface that isn’t a plane, passing cables through a
house, whatever – the puzzle has no solution.
                     Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 295




                                                 A cheat that works by
                                                 passing a cable
                                                 through a house.

   If you experiment, you’ll soon become convinced that it’s
impossible – but mathematicians require proof. To find one, we first
connect things up without worrying about crossings, like this:




                                      Can this be redrawn without
                                      crossings?

   While we’re at it, I’ve replaced the buildings by dots.
   Now, suppose that we could redraw this picture, keeping all the
connections at the dots, to eliminate the crossings. Then the lines
would form a kind of map in the plane. This map would have E ¼ 9
edges (the nine connections) and V ¼ 6 vertices (the six dots). Euler’s
formula for maps (page 177) tells us that if F is the number of faces,
then

       FEþV ¼2

so F  9 þ 6 ¼ 2 and F ¼ 5. One of these faces is infinitely large and
forms the outside of the whole diagram.
   Now we count the edges in another way. Each face has a
boundary formed by a loop of edges. You can check that the possible
loops in the diagram contain either 4 or 6 distinct edges, nothing
296 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



else. So there are six possibilities for the number of edges in the five
faces:

         4   4   4   4   4
         4   4   4   4   6
         4   4   4   6   6
         4   4   6   6   6
         4   6   6   6   6
         6   6   6   6   6

which respectively total 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 and 30. But every edge
forms the border between two faces, so the number of edges has to be
half of one of these numbers: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15.
    However, we already know that there should be 9 faces. This is a
contradiction, so we can’t redraw the diagram to have no crossings.
    People often claim that ‘You can’t prove a negative.’ In
mathematics, you most certainly can.


Don’t Get the Goat
No, there isn’t. The contestant doubles their chance of success by
changing their mind. But this is true only under the stated
assumptions. For example, suppose that the host (who knows where
the car is, remember) offers the contestant the opportunity to change
their mind only when they have correctly chosen the door with the
car behind it. In this extreme case, they always lose if they change
their mind. At the other extreme, if he offers the contestant the
opportunity to change their mind only when they have chosen a
door with a goat behind it, they always win.
    Fine – but what if my original assumptions are valid. The fifty–
fifty argument then looks convincing, but it’s wrong. The reason is
that the host’s procedure does not make the odds fifty–fifty.
    When the contestant makes their initial choice, the probability
that they have the right door is one in three. So on average and in the
long run, the car is behind that particular door one time in three.
Nothing that happens subsequently can change that. (Unless the
television people surreptitiously move the prizes . . . OK, let’s assume
that doesn’t happen either.)
    After a goat is revealed, the contestant is left with two doors. The
car must be behind one of them (the host never reveals the car). One
                      Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 297



time in three that door is the one that the contestant has chosen. The
other two times out of three, it must be behind the other door. So, if
you don’t change your mind, you win the car one time in three. If
you do, you win it two times in three – twice the chance.
   The trouble with such reasoning is that unless you’ve spent a lot
of time learning probability theory, it’s not always clear what works
and what doesn’t. You can experiment using dice to decide where the
car goes: 1 or 2 puts it behind the first door, 3 or 4 behind the second,
5 or 6 behind the third, say. If you try this twenty or thirty times, it
soon becomes clear that changing your mind really does improve the
chance of success. I once got an
e-mail from some people who had been arguing about this problem
in the pub, until one of them got out his laptop and programmed it
to simulate a million attempts. ‘Don’t change your mind’ succeeded
on roughly 333,300 occasions. ‘Do change your mind’ succeeded on
the remaining 666,700 occasions. It’s fascinating that we live in a
world where you can do this simulation in a few minutes in a pub.
Nearly all of which is taken up writing the computer program – the
actual sums take less than a second.
   Still not convinced? Sometimes people see the light when the
problem is taken to extremes. Take a normal pack of 52 playing cards,
held face down. Ask a friend to pull a card from the pack, without
looking at it, and lay it on the table. They win if that card is the ace of
spades (car) and lose otherwise (goat). So now we have one car and 51
goats, behind 52 doors (cards). But you now pick up the remaining 51
cards, holding them so that you can see their faces but your friend
can’t. Now you discard 50 of those cards, none being the ace of
spades. One card remains in your hand; one is on the table. Is it really
true that each of these two cards has a fifty–fifty chance of being the
ace of spades? So why were you so careful to hang on to that
particular card out of the 51 you started with? Clearly you have a big
advantage over your friend. They got to choose one card, without
seeing its face. You had a choice of 51 cards, and you did see their
faces. They have one chance in 52 of being right; you have 51
chances. This is a fair game? Pull the other one!

All Triangles are Isosceles
The mistake is the innocent assertion that X is inside the triangle. If
you draw the picture accurately, it’s not. And it turns out that exactly
one of the points D and E is outside the triangle, too. In this particular
case, D is not between A and C. But the other point is ‘inside’ the
triangle—well, on its edge, but not outside it. Here E lies between B
and C. This diagram makes it clear what I mean:




                                                 The correct picture.


    Now the argument collapses. We still find that CE ¼ CD and DA
¼ EB (steps 5 and 9). But in step 10, CA ¼ CD  DA, not CD þ DA.
However, CB is still CE þ EB. So we can’t conclude that lines CA and
CB are equal.
    Fallacies like this one explain why mathematicians are so
obsessive about hidden logical assumptions in proofs.


Square Year
We are looking for squares either side of 2001. A little experiment
reveals that 442 ¼ 1936, and 452 ¼ 2025. With these figures, Betty’s
father was born in 1936  44 ¼ 1892 (so he died in 1992), and Alfie was
born in 2025  45 ¼ 1980.
   To rule out any other answers: the previous possible date for
Betty’s father would be 432  43 ¼ 1806, so he would have died in
1906, making Betty well past retirement age. The next possible date
for Alfie would be 462  46 ¼ 2070, so he wouldn’t get born in 2001.

Infinite Wealth
Whatever amount you win, it will be finite (unless the game goes on
for ever, with you always tossing tails, in which case you win an
infinite amount of cash, but you have to wait infinitely long to get
it). So it’s silly to pay an infinite entry fee. The correct deduction is
that whatever finite entry fee you pay, your expected winnings are
bigger. Your chance of a big win is of course very small, but the win is
so huge that it compensates you for the tiny chance of success.
    But that still seems silly, and this is where the mathematicians of
the time started scratching their heads (and very likely their tails too,
though we don’t mention such things in polite company). The main
source of trouble is that the expected winnings form a divergent series
– one with no well-defined sum – which may not make a great deal of
sense.
    As a practical matter, the sums involved are limited by two
features that the simple mathematical model fails to take into
account: the largest amount that the bank can actually pay, and the
length of time available to play the game – at most one human
lifetime. If the bank has only £220 available, for instance, which is
£1,048,576, then you are justified in risking £20. If the bank has £250
available, which is £1,125,899,906,842,624 – a little over a quad-
rillion pounds, which exceeds the annual Gross Global Product, then
you are justified in risking £50.
    There is a more philosophical point: how sensible the long-term
average winnings (expectation) actually is when the ‘long term’ is far
longer than any player can actually play for. If you are playing
against a bank with £250 in its coffers, it will typically take you 250
attempts to make the big win that justifies you spending £50, let
alone a much larger amount. Human decisions about risk are subtler
than the mindless computation of long-term expectations, and the
subtleties are important exactly when the gain (or loss) is very big but
its probability is very small.
     A related point is the relevance of long-term averages over
numerous trials, if in practice you only get to play once, or just a few
times. Then you have an extraordinarily small chance of a big win,
and the pragmatic decision is not to throw money at something so
unlikely.
300 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



    On the other hand, in cases where the expectation converges to a
finite sum, it may make more sense. Suppose that you win £n if the
first toss of a head is on the nth throw. Now the expectation is

          1     1      1      1
        16 þ 26 2 þ 36 3 þ 46 4 þ . . .
          2    2      2      2
which converges to 2. So here you should pay £2 to break even,
which seems fair enough.


What Shape is a Rainbow?
The arcs are parts of circles. For a given colour, the arc concerned is very
thin. All the circles involved have the same centre – which is often below
the horizon. The interesting question is – why? The answer turns out to
be distinctly complicated, though very elegant. Teacher was right to
direct our attention to the colours, though she did miss an opportunity
to do some really neat geometry.
    Consider light of a single wavelength (colour), and look at a
raindrop in cross-section. Raindrops are spheres, so in section we get
a circle. A ray of light from the Sun hits the front of the drop, is
refracted (bent through an angle) by the water, reflects off the back of
the drop, and is refracted a second time as it leaves the drop and
heads back roughly the way it came.




        (Left) The path of one ray. (Right) Many rays.

    That’s what happens to one ray, but in reality there are lots of
them. Rays that are very close together usually hit the same drop, but
turn through slightly different angles. But there is a focusing effect,
and most of the light comes back out along a single ‘critical
direction’. Bearing in mind the spherical geometry of the drop, the
                       Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 301



end result is that effectively each drop emits a cone of light of the
chosen colour. The axis of the cone joins the drop to the Sun. The
vertex angle of the cone is about 428, for a raindrop, but it depends
on the colour of the light.
    When an observer looks at the sky, in the direction of the rain,
she observes light only from those drops whose cones meet her eye. A
little geometry shows that these drops themselves lie on a cone,
whose tip is at her eye, and whose axis is the line joining her eye to
the Sun. Again, the vertex angle is about 428, depending on the
colour of the light.




        The eye receives a cone of light.

    If you place a cone to your eye and sight along it, what you see is
the edge of its circular base. More accurately, the directions of the
incoming light are perceived as if the light were being emitted by the
circular base. So the upshot is that the eye ‘sees’ a circular arc. The arc
is not up there in the sky: it is an illusion, caused by the directions of
the incoming light rays.
    Usually, the eye sees only part of this circular arc. If the Sun is
high in the sky, most of the arc is below the horizon. If the Sun is low,
the eye sees almost a semicircle. From an aircraft a complete circle
can sometimes be seen. If the rain is nearby, the arc may appear to be
in front of other parts of the landscape. The arc is often partial – you
see the returning light only when there’s rain in that direction.
    Because different colours of light lead to different vertex angles
for the cone, each colour appears on a slightly different arc, but they
all have the same centre. So we see ‘parallel’ arcs of colours.
    Sometimes you can see a second rainbow, outside the first. This is
302 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



formed in a similar way, but the light bounces more times before
coming back out of the drop. The vertex angle of the cone is
different, and the colours are in reverse order. The sky is brighter
inside the main rainbow, very dark between this and the ‘secondary’
rainbow, and medium-dark outside that. Again, all this can be
explained in terms of the geometry of the light rays. René Descartes
did that in 1637.

Alien Abduction
Each alien is going after the pig that initially is nearest to it. If they
chase the other pig, they will soon catch it.
    Why? The way to catch a pig is to drive it into a corner. If the
position looks like the next picture, and it is the pig’s turn to move, it
will be abducted. However, if it is the alien’s turn to move, the pig can
escape.

                                  – provided the pig has to move.

    Which of these happens depends on the parity (odd or even) of
the distance (in moves) from alien to pig. If the pig is an even number
of moves away – as it is if each alien goes for the pig it is initially
facing – then the pig always escapes. If it is odd – as it is if the aliens
switch pigs – then the pig can be driven into a corner and abducted.


Disproof of the Riemann Hypothesis
The argument is logically correct. However, it doesn’t disprove the
Riemann Hypothesis! The information given is contradictory: it
implies that an elephant has won Mastermind, and also that it has
not. We can now prove the Riemann Hypothesis false by contra-
diction:
                       Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 303



(1) Assume, on the contrary, that the Riemann Hypothesis is
true.

(2) Then an elephant has won Mastermind.

(3) But an elephant has not won Mastermind.

(4) This is a contradiction. So our assumption that the Riemann
Hypothesis is true is wrong.

(5) Therefore the Riemann Hypothesis is false.

The same argument proves that the Riemann Hypothesis is true, of
course.


Murder in the Park




          The two possible topological types of path.

   Topologically speaking, there are just two cases to consider.
Either the butler went to the north of Y on his way to X (left-hand
diagram) or he went to the south (right-hand diagram). The
gamekeeper must then have gone to the south (respectively north) of
X on his way to Y.
   The tracks of the youth and the grocer’s wife must then be as
shown, perhaps with additional wiggles. In the first case, the grocer’s
wife’s path from C to F cuts off the youth’s path from the part of the
park that contains the body. In fact, only she and the butler could
have approached the place where Hastings’s body lay. The same is
true in the second case. Since the butler has a confirmed alibi, the
murderer must have been the grocer’s wife.

The Cube of Cheese
The corners of the hexagon lie on various midpoints of sides of the
cube, like this:

Drawing an Ellipse – and More?




        The pencil draws arcs of various ellipses.

When the pencil is in the position shown on the left, the length of
string ACþCB is constant, so the pencil moves as if you had looped a
shorter string round A and B. Therefore it draws an arc of an ellipse
with foci A and B. When it moves to a position like the one on the
right, it draws an arc of an ellipse with foci A and C. The complete
curve therefore consists of six arcs of ellipses, joined together. Since
basically this isn’t new, mathematicians aren’t (terribly) interested.

The Milk Crate Problem
The milkman is correct for 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 and 36 bottles, but wrong
for 49 and any larger square number.
    If you think about this the right way, it’s obvious that when the
number of bottles gets sufficiently large, the square lattice packing
can’t possibly be the best. (What is the best is horribly difficult to
work out, and nobody knows.) The square lattice must fail for a large
number of bottles, because a hexagonal lattice packs bottles more
closely than a square one. When there aren’t too many bottles, ‘edge
effects’ near the walls of the crate stop you exploiting this fact to
make the crate smaller, but as the numbers go up the edge effects
become negligible.
    It so happens that the break-even point is close to 49 bottles. And
it has been proved that 49 bottles of unit diameter can fit inside a
square whose side is very slightly less than 7 units. The difference is
too small to be seen by the naked eye, but you can easily see big
regions of hexagonally packed circles.




        (Left) 49 unit bottles in a 767 square. (Right) How to fit the same
        bottles into a slightly smaller square.

    Incidentally, this example shows that a rigid packing – one in
which no single circle can move – need not be the closest packing
possible. The square lattice is rigid for any square number of bottles
inside a tightly fitting square crate. Or, indeed, on the infinite plane.

Dragon Curve
Dragon curves can be made by repeatedly folding a strip of paper in
half – always folding the same way – and then opening it out to make
all folds into right angles.




        Making dragon curves by paper-folding.

    These curves determine a fractal (page 189). In fact, the infinite
limit is a space-filling curve (page 83), but the region it fills has a
complicated, dragon-like shape. The sequence of right (R) and left (L)
turns in the curve goes like this:

Step 1 R

Step 2 R R L

Step 3 R R L R R L L

Step 4 R R L R R L L R R R L L R L L

In fact, there is a simple pattern: each sequence is formed from the
previous one by placing an extra R at the end, followed by the reverse
of the previous sequence with R’s and L’s swapped. I’ve marked the
extra R in the middle in bold.
    The dragon curve was discovered by John Heighway, Bruce Banks
and William Harter – all physicists at NASA – and was mentioned in
Martin Gardner’s Mathematical Games’ column in Scientific American
in 1967. It has lots of intriguing features – see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/

Counterflip
Assume that there is an odd number of black counters—so in
particular, there exists at least one of them. As play progresses,
counters that are removed create gaps, breaking the row of counters
into connected pieces, which I’ll call chains. We start with one chain.
308 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



   I claim that any chain with an odd number of black counters can
be removed. Here’s a method that always works. (The sample game
doesn’t always follow it, so other methods work too.)
    Starting from one end of the chain, find the first black counter. I
claim that if you flip that counter, then there are three possibilities:

(1) The chain originally consisted of one isolated black counter,
and when you flip it it is removed, with no effect on any other
counters.

(2) You now have a single shorter chain having an odd number
of black counters.

(3) You now have two shorter chains, each having an odd
number of black counters.

If this claim is true, then you can repeat the same procedure on the
shorter chains. The number of chains may grow, but they get shorter
at each step. Eventually they all become so short that we reach case 1
and they can be removed entirely.
   The claim is proved by seeing what happens in three cases of a
single chain, which exhaust the possibilities:

(1) The chain concerned consists of a single black counter. It has
no neighbours, so when it is flipped it disappears.

(2) The chain has a black counter at one end. Flipping the end
counter results in a shorter chain which has an odd number of
black counters.

                                       Grey counters may be either
                                       black or white. The black
                                       counter on the end disappears,
                                       and its neighbour (here shown
                                       white) changes colour. The
                                       overall change in the number of
                                       black counters is either 0 or 2,
                                       so an odd number of black
                                       counters remains.

(3) The chain has white counters at both ends. Flipping the first
black counter from one end (it doesn’t matter which) results in
                     Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet // 309



two shorter chains. One has a single black counter (which is odd)
and the other has an odd number of black counters.
                                                 The first black counter
                                                 (from the left)
                                                 disappears, and its
                                                 neighbours (one white,
                                                 one grey – i.e. black or
                                                 white) change colour.
                                                 Two chains are created;
                                                 one has one black
                                                 counter, the other has
                                                 an odd number of black
                                                 counters.

   It does matter which black counter you flip. For instance, if the
chain has at least four counters, with three black counters next to one
another and the rest white, then it is a mistake to flip the middle
black counter. If you do, you get at least one chain containing no
black counters at all, so this chain cannot be removed.


                                    Oops . . .

   To complete the analysis, here’s why the puzzle can’t be solved if
the initial number of black counters is even:

(1) If there are no black counters (zero is even!) you can’t get
started.

(2) If the initial number of black counters is even (and non-zero),
then whichever black counter you remove, at least one shorter
chain is created that also has an even number of black counters.
Repeating this process eventually leads to a chain with no black
counters but at least one white one. This chain cannot be
removed since there is no place to start.

Spherical Sliced Bread
All slices have exactly the same amount of crust.
    At first sight this seems unlikely, but slices near the top and
bottom are more slanted than those near the middle, so they have
310 // Professor Stewart’s Cunning Crib Sheet



more crust than you might think. It turns out that the slope exactly
compensates for the smaller size of the slices.
    In fact, the great Greek mathematician Archimedes discovered
that the surface area of a slice of a sphere is equal to that of the
corresponding slice of a cylinder into which the sphere fits. It is
obvious that parallel slices of a cylindrical loaf, of equal thickness, all
have the same amount of crust . . . since they are all the same shape
and size.




        The surface area of the spherical band (pale blue) is the same as
        that of the corresponding band on a tightly fitting cylinder.


Mathematical Theology
I asked you to start from 2 þ 2 ¼ 5 and prove that 1 ¼ 1 and also that
1 ¼ 42. There are lots of valid answers (infinitely many, in fact). Here
are two that work:

. Since 2 þ 2 ¼ 4, we deduce that 4 ¼ 5. Double both sides to get
    8 ¼ 10. Subtract 9 from each side to get 1 ¼ 1. Square both
    sides to get 1 ¼ 1.
.   Since 2 þ 2 ¼ 4, we deduce that 4 ¼ 5. Subtract 4 from each
    side to get 0 ¼ 1. Multiply both sides by 41 to get 0 ¼ 41. Add
    1 to each side to get 1 ¼ 42.
