A Little-Known Pythagorean Curiosity
It is well known that any two Pythagorean triples can be
combined to yield another one. In fact, if

       a2 þ b2 ¼ c 2

and

       A2 þ B2 ¼ C2

then

       ðaA  bBÞ2 þ ðaB þ bAÞ2 ¼ ðcCÞ2

However, there is a lesser-known feature of this method for
combining Pythagorean triples. If you think of it as a kind of
‘multiplication’ for triples, then we can define a triple to be prime
if it is not the product of two smaller triples. Then every
Pythagorean triple is a product of distinct prime Pythagorean
triples; moreover, this ‘prime factorisation’ of triples is essen-
tially unique, except for some trivial distinctions which I won’t
go into here.
     It turns out that the prime triples are those for which the
hypotenuse is a prime number of the form 4k þ 1 and the other
two sides are both non-zero, or the hypotenuse is 2 or a prime of
the form 4k  1 and one of the other sides is zero (a ‘degenerate’
triple).
     For instance, the 3–4–5 triple is prime, and so is the 5–12–13
triple, because their hypotenuses are both 4k þ 1 primes. The
0–7–7 triple is also prime. The 33–56–65 triple is not prime – it is
the ‘product’ of the 3–4–5 and 5–12–13 triples.
