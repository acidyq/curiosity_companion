What is a Mersenne Prime?
A Mersenne number is a number of the form 2n  1. That is, it is
one less than a power of 2. A Mersenne prime is a Mersenne
number that happens also to be prime. It is straightforward to
prove that in this case the exponent n must itself be prime. For
the first few primes, n ¼ 2, 3, 5 and 7, the corresponding
Mersenne numbers 3, 7, 31 and 127 are all prime.
     Interest in Mersenne numbers goes back a long way, and
initially it was thought that they are prime whenever n is prime.
However, in 1536 Hudalricus Regius proved that this assumption
is false, pointing out that 211  1 ¼ 2;047 ¼ 23689. In 1603 Pietro
Cataldi noted that 217  1 and 219  1 are prime, which is correct,
and claimed that n ¼ 23, 29, 31 and 37 also lead to primes.
Fermat proved that he was wrong for 23 and 37, and Euler
demolished his claim for 29. But Euler later proved that 231  1 is
prime.
     In his 1644 book Cogitata Physico-Mathematica, the French
monk Marin Mersenne stated that 2n  1 is prime when n is 2, 3,
5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127 and 257 – and for no other values in
that range. Using the methods then available, he could not have
tested most of these numbers, so his claims were mainly
guesswork, but his name became associated with the problem.
     In 1876 Édouard Lucas developed a cunning way to test
Mersenne numbers to see if they are prime, and showed that
Mersenne was right for n ¼ 127. By 1947 all cases in Mersenne’s
range had been checked, and it turned out that he had
mistakenly included 67 and 257. He had also omitted 61, 89 and

107. Lucas improved his test, and in the 1930s Derrick Lehmer
found further improvements. The Lucas–Lehmer test uses the
sequence of numbers
                  4; 14; 194; 37634; . . .

in which each number is the square of the previous one,
decreased by 2. It can be proved that the nth Mersenne number is
prime if and only if it divides the (n  1)th term of this sequence.
This test can prove that a Mersenne number is composite
without finding any of its prime factors, and it can prove the
number is prime without testing for any prime factors. There’s a
trick to keep all numbers involved in the test smaller than the
Mersenne number concerned.
    Looking for new, larger Mersenne primes is an amusing way
to try out new, fast computers, and over the years prime-hunters
have extended the list. It now includes 44 primes:

Up to and including the 39th Mersenne prime (n ¼ 13,466,917)
the list is complete, but there may be undiscovered Mersenne
primes in the gaps between the known ones after that. The 44th
known Mersenne prime, 232;582;657  1, has 9,808,358 decimal
digits and is currently (December 2007) the largest known prime.
Mersenne primes generally hold this record, thanks to the Lucas–
Lehmer test; however, we know from Euclid that there is no largest
prime. For up-to-date information, go to the Mersenne Primes
