Fair Shares
In 1944, as the Russian army fought to reclaim Poland from the
Germans, the mathematician Hugo Steinhaus, trapped in the
city of Lvov, sought distraction in a puzzle. As you do.
    The puzzle was this. Several people want to share a cake (by
all means replace that by a pizza if you wish). And they want the
procedure to be fair, in the sense that no one will feel that they
have got less than their fair share.
    Steinhaus knew that for two people there is a simple method:
one person cuts the cake into two pieces, and the other chooses
which one they want. The second person can’t complain,
because they made the choice. The first person also can’t
complain – if they do, it was their fault for cutting the cake
wrongly.
    How can three people divide a cake fairly?
