Ring a-Ring a-Ringroad
The M25 motorway completely encircles London, and in Britain
we drive on the left. So if you travel clockwise round the M25
you stay on the outside carriageway, whereas travelling anti-
clockwise keeps you on the inside carriageway, which is shorter.
But how much shorter? The total length of the M25 is 188 km
(117 miles), so the advantage of being on the inside carriageway
ought to be quite a lot – shouldn’t it?




                                                                      The M25
                                                                      motorway.
68 // Pure v. Applied



   Suppose that two cars travel right round the M25, staying in
the outside lane—no, make that two white vans travelling right
round the M25, staying in the outside lane, as they tend to do.
Assume that one is going clockwise and the other anticlockwise,
and suppose (which is not entirely true but makes the problem
specific) that the distance between these two lanes is always 10
metres. How much further does the clockwise van travel than the
anticlockwise one? You may assume that the roads all lie in a flat
plane (which also isn’t entirely true).
