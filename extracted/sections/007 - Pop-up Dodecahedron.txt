Pop-up Dodecahedron
The dodecahedron is a solid made from twelve pentagons, and is
one of the five regular solids (page 174).




       Three stages in making a pop-up dodecahedron.

    Cut out two identical copies of the left-hand diagram – 10 cm
across – from thickish card. Crease heavily along the joins so that
the five pentagonal flaps are nice and floppy. Place one copy on
top of the other, like the centre diagram. Lace an elastic band
alternately over and under, as in the right-hand diagram (thick
solid lines show where the band is on top) – while holding the
pieces down with your finger.
    Now let go.
    If you’ve got the right size and strength of elastic band, the
whole thing will pop up to form a three-dimensional dodeca-
hedron.
