Coin Swap
The first diagram shows six silver coins, A, C, E, G, I and K,
and six gold coins, B, D, F, H, J and L. Your job is to move the
coins into the arrangement shown in the second diagram. Each
move must swap one silver coin with one adjacent gold coin;
two coins are adjacent if there is a straight line joining them.
The smallest number of moves that solves this puzzle is known
to be 17. Can you find a 17-move solution?
