How to do Lots of Mathematics
Leonhard Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time.
He was born in 1707 in Basel, Switzerland, and died in 1783 in St
Petersburg, Russia. He wrote more than 800 research papers, and
a long list of books. Euler had 13 children, and often worked on
his mathematics while one of them sat on his knee. He lost the
sight of one eye in 1735, probably because of a cataract; the other
eye failed in 1766. Going blind seems to have had no effect on
his productivity. His family took notes, and he had an
astonishing mental powers – once doing a mental calculation to
fifty decimal places to decide which of two students had the right
answer.

    Euler spent many years at the court of Queen Catherine the
Great. It has been suggested that to avoid becoming embroiled in
court politics – which could easily prove fatal – Euler spent
nearly all of his time working on mathematics, except when he
was asleep. That way it was obvious that he had no time for
intrigue.
    Which reminds me of a mathematical joke: Why should a
mathematician keep a mistress as well as a wife? (For gender-
equality reasons, feel free to change to ‘a lover as well as a

mistress, and the mistress thinks you’re with the wife, you have

Euler’s Pentagonal Holiday
Here’s your chance to put Euler’s discoveries about tours on
networks to the test. (a) Find an open tour of this network.
(b) Find one that looks the same when you reflect the figure to
interchange left and right.
