Where There’s a Wall, There’s a Way
In the county of Hexshire, fields are separated by walls built from
the local stones – which for some reason are all made from
identical hexagonal lumps joined together. Perhaps they origi-
nated as basalt columns like the ones in the Giant’s Causeway.
Anyway, Farmer Hogswill has seven stones, each formed from
four hexagons. In fact, they are precisely the seven possible
combinations of four hexagons:




                                                    Seven stones
                                                    to make a wall.


   He has to make a wall shaped like this:




                                                    The required
                                                    wall.

   How can he do it? (He can rotate the stones and turn them
over to obtain their mirror images if necessary.)
