Is There a Perfect Cuboid?
It is easy to find rectangles whose sides and diagonals are whole
numbers – this is the hoary old problem of Pythagorean
triangles, and it has been known since antiquity how to find all
of them (page 58). Using the classical recipe, it is not too hard to
find a cuboid – a box with rectangular sides – such that its sides,
and the diagonals of all its faces, are whole numbers. The first set
of values given below achieves this. But what no one has yet been
able to find is a perfect cuboid – one in which the ‘long diagonal’
between opposite corners of the cuboid is also a whole number.

                                               Make all lengths
                                               integers.



    With the notation in the diagram, and bearing Pythagoras in
mind, we have to find a, b and c so that all four of the numbers
a2 þ b2 ; a2 þ c2 ; b2 þ c2 and a2 þ b2 þ c2 are perfect squares – equal,
respectively, to p2 ; q2 ; r2 and s2 . The existence of such numbers
has neither been proved nor disproved, but some ‘near misses’
have been found:

        a ¼ 240; b ¼ 117; c ¼ 44; p ¼ 267; q ¼ 244; r ¼ 125;
          but s is not an integer
        a ¼ 672; b ¼ 153; c ¼ 104; q ¼ 680; r ¼ 185; s ¼ 697;
          but p is not an integer
        a ¼ 18;720; b ¼ 211;773;121; c ¼ 7;800; p ¼ 23;711;
          q ¼ 20;280; r ¼ 16;511; s ¼ 24;961; but b is not an integer

If there is a perfect cuboid, it involves big numbers: it has been
