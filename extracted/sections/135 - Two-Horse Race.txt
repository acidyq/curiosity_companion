Two-Horse Race
Every whole number can be obtained by multiplying suitable
primes together. If this requires an even number of primes, we
say that the number is of even type. If it requires an odd number
of primes, we say that the number is of odd type. For instance,
       96 ¼ 26262626263
                                            Two-Horse Race // 229



uses six primes, so is of even type. On the other hand,
       105 ¼ 36567

uses three primes, so is of odd type. By convention, 1 is of even
type.
   For the first ten whole numbers, 1–10, the types are:
       Odd        2 3        5       7 8
       Even 1            4       6         9 10

A striking fact emerges: in general, odd types occur at least as
frequently as even types. Imagine two horses, Odd and Even,
racing. Start them level with each other, and read along the
sequence of numbers: 1; 2; 3; . . . At each stage, move Odd forward
one step if the next number has odd type; move Even forward
one step if the next number has even type. So:
       After 1 step, Even is ahead.
       After 2 steps, Odd and Even are level.
       After 3 steps, Odd is ahead.
       After 4 steps, Odd and Even are level.
       After 5 steps, Odd is ahead.
       After 6 steps, Odd and Even are level.
       After 7 steps, Odd is ahead.
       After 8 steps, Odd is ahead.
       After 9 steps, Odd is ahead.
       After 10 steps, Odd and Even are level.
Odd always seems to be level, or ahead. In 1919 George Pólya
conjectured that Odd never falls behind Even, except right at the
start, step 1. Calculations showed that this is true for the first
million steps. Given this weight of favourable evidence, surely it
has to be true for any number of steps?
    Without a computer you can waste a lot of time on this
question, so I’ll tell you the answer. Pólya was wrong! In 1958,
Brian Haselgrove proved that at some (unknown) stage Odd falls
behind Even. Once reasonably fast computers were available, it
was easy to test ever larger numbers. In 1960 Robert Lehman
discovered that Even is in the lead at step 906,180,359. In 1980
230 // Drawing an Ellipse – and More?



Minoru Tanaka proved that Even first takes the lead at step
906,150,257.
    This kind of thing is what makes mathematicians insist upon
proofs. And it shows that even a number like 906,150,257 can be
