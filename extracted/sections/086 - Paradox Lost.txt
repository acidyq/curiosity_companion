Paradox Lost
In mathematical logic, a paradox is a self-contradictory statement
– the best known is ‘This sentence is a lie.’ Another is Bertrand
Russell’s ‘barber paradox’. In a village there is a barber who
shaves everyone who does not shave themselves. So who shaves
the barber? Neither ‘the barber’ nor ‘someone else’ is logically
acceptable. If it is the barber, then he shaves himself – but we are
told that he doesn’t. But if it’s someone else, then the barber does

not shave himself . . . but we are told that he shaves all such
people, so he does shave himself.
     In the real world, there are plenty of get-outs (are we talking
about shaving beards here, or legs, or what? Is the barber a
woman? Can such a barber actually exist anyway?) But in
mathematics, a more carefully stated version of Russell’s paradox
ruined the life’s work of Gottlob Frege, who attempted to base
the whole of mathematics on set theory – the study of collections
of objects, and how these can be combined to form other
collections.
     Here’s another famous (alleged) paradox:
     Protagoras was a Greek lawyer who lived and taught in the
fifth century BC. He had a student, and it was agreed that the
student would pay for his teaching after he had won his first case.
But the student didn’t get any clients, and eventually Protagoras
threatened to sue him. Protagoras reckoned that he would win
either way: if the court upheld his case, the student would be
required to pay up, but if Protagoras lost, then by their
agreement the student would have to pay anyway. The student
argued exactly the other way round: if Protagoras won, then by
their agreement the student did not have to pay, but if Protagoras
lost, the court would have ruled that the student did not have to
pay.
     Is this a genuine logical paradox or not?
