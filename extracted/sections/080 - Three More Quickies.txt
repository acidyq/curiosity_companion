Three More Quickies
(1) If five dogs dig five holes in five days, how long does it take
ten dogs to dig ten holes? Assume that they all dig at the same
rate all the time and all holes are the same size.

(2) A woman bought a parrot in a pet-shop. The shop assistant,
who always told the truth, said, ‘I guarantee that this parrot will
repeat every word it hears.’ A week later, the woman took the
parrot back, complaining that it hadn’t spoken a single word.
‘Did anyone talk to it?’ asked the suspicious assistant. ‘Oh, yes.’
What is the explanation?

(3) The planet Nff-Pff in the Anathema Galaxy is inhabited by
precisely two sentient beings, Nff and Pff. Nff lives on a large
114 // Miles of Tiles



continent, in the middle of which is an enormous lake. Pff lives
on an island in the middle of the lake. Neither Nff nor Pff can
swim, fly or teleport: their only form of transport is to walk on
dry land. Yet each morning, one walks to the other’s house for
breakfast. Explain.
