Magic Squares
I’m on a bit of a square kick here, so let me mention the most
ancient ‘square’ mathematical recreation of them all. According
to a Chinese myth, the Emperor Yu, who lived in the third
millennium BC, came across a sacred turtle in a tributary of the
Yellow River, with strange markings on its shell. These markings
are now known as the Lo shu (‘Lo river writing’).




                                           The Lo Shu.


   The markings are numbers, and they form a square pattern:
       4 9 2
       3 5 7
       8 1 6
Here every row, every column and every diagonal adds to the
same number, 15. A number square with these properties is said
to be magic, and the number concerned is its magic constant.
Usually the square is made from successive whole numbers, 1, 2,
3, 4, and so on, but sometimes this condition is relaxed.

       Dürer’s Melancholia and its magic square.

   In 1514 the artist Albrecht Dürer produced an engraving,
‘Melancholia’, containing a 464 magic square (top right corner).
The middle numbers in the bottom row are 15–14, the date of
the work. This square contains the numbers
       16   3   2 13
       5    10 11 8
        9   6   7    12
        4   15 14     1

and has magic constant 34.
    Using consecutive whole numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , and counting
rotations and reflections of a given square as being the same,
there are precisely:

. 1 magic square of size 363
. 880 magic squares of size 464
. 27,5305,224 magic squares of size 565
The number of 666 magic squares is unknown, but has been
estimated by statistical methods to be about 1:7761019 .
    The literature on magic squares is gigantic, including many
variations such as magic cubes. The website mathworld.wolfram.
