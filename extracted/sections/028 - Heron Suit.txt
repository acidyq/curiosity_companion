Heron Suit
        No cat that wears a heron suit is unsociable.
        No cat without a tail will play with a gorilla.
        Cats with whiskers always wear heron suits.
        No sociable cat has blunt claws.
        No cats have tails unless they have whiskers.
           Therefore:
        No cat with blunt claws will play with a gorilla.
           Is the deduction logically correct?
