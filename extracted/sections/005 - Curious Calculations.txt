Curious Calculations
Your calculator can do tricks.

(1) Try these multiplications. What do you notice?

       161
       11611
       1116111
       111161111
       11;111611;111

Does the pattern continue if you use longer strings of 1â€™s?

(2) Enter the number
       142;857

(preferably into the memory) and multiply it by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and
7. What do you notice?
