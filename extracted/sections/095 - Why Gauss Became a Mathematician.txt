Why Gauss Became a Mathematician




                                    Carl Friedrich Gauss.

   Carl Friedrich Gauss was born in Brunswick in 1777 and died
in Göttingen in 1855. His parents were uneducated manual
workers, but he became one of the greatest mathematicians ever;
many consider him the best. He was precocious – he is said to
have pointed out a mistake in his father’s financial calculations
when he was three. At the age of nineteen he had to decide
whether to study mathematics or languages, and the decision
was made for him when he discovered how to construct a regular
17-sided polygon using the traditional Euclidean tools of an
unmarked ruler and a compass.
   This may not sound like much, but it was totally unprece-
dented, and the discovery led to a new branch of number theory.
Euclid’s Elements contains constructions for regular polygons (all

sides equal length, all angles equal) with 3, 4, 5, 6 and 15 sides,
and the ancient Greeks knew that the number of sides could be
doubled as often as you wish. Up to 100, the number of sides in a
constructible (regular) polygon – as far as the Greeks knew – must
be

       2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 8; 10; 12; 15; 16; 20; 24; 30; 32; 40;
       48; 60; 64; 80; 96

For more than two thousand years, everyone assumed that no
other polygons were constructible. In particular, Euclid does not
tell us how to construct 7-gons or 9-gons, and the reason is that
he had no idea how this might be done. Gauss’s discovery was a
bombshell, adding 17, 34 and 68 to the list. Even more
amazingly, his methods prove that other numbers, such as 7, 9,
11 and 13, are impossible. (The polygons do exist, but you can’t
construct them by Euclidean methods.)
     Gauss’s construction depends on two simple facts about the
number 17: it is prime, and it is one greater than a power of 2.
The whole problem pretty much reduces to finding which prime
numbers correspond to constructible polygons, and powers of 2
come into the story because every Euclidean construction boils
down to taking a series of square roots – which in particular
implies that the lengths of any lines that feature in the
construction must satisfy algebraic equations whose degree is a
power of two. The key equation for the 17-gon is

       x16 þ x15 þ x14 þ x13 þ x12 þ x11 þ x10 þ x9 þ x8 þ x7 þ x6
           þ x5 þ x4 þ x3 þ x2 þ x þ 1 ¼ 0

where x is a complex number. The 16 solutions, together with the
number 1, form the vertices of a regular 17-gon in the complex
plane. Since 16 is a power of 2, Gauss realised that he was in with
a chance. He did some clever calculations, and proved that the

17-gon can be constructed provided you can construct a line
whose length is

Since you can always construct square roots, this effectively
solves the problem, and Gauss didn’t bother to describe the
precise steps needed – the formula itself does that. Later, other
mathematicians wrote down explicit constructions. Ulrich von
Huguenin published the first in 1803, and H.W. Richmond
found a simpler one in 1893.




              Richmond’s method for constructing a regular 17-gon. Take two
              perpendicular radii, AOP0 and BOC, of a circle. Make 4OB  OJ
                                                                           ¼1
                          OJE
              and angle 4OJP  0
                                ¼ 1. Find F Such that angle EJF is 458. Draw a
              circle with FP0 as diameter, meeting OB at K. Draw the circle
              with centre E through K, cutting AP0 in G and H. Draw HP3 and
              GP5 perpendicular to AP0. Then P0, P3 and P5 are respectively
              the 0th, 3rd and 5th vertices of a regular 17-gon, and the other
              vertices are now easily constructed.

    Gauss’s method proves that a regular n-gon can be con-
structed whenever n is a prime of the form 2k þ 1. Primes like this
are called Fermat primes, because Fermat investigated them. In

particular he noticed that k must itself be a power of 2 if 2k þ 1 is
going to be prime. The values k = 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 yield the
Fermat primes 3, 5, 17, 257 and 65,537. However, 232 þ 1 ¼
4;294;967;297 ¼ 64166;700;417 is not prime. Gauss was aware that
the regular n-gon is constructible if and only if n is a power of 2,
or a power of 2 multiplied by distinct Fermat primes. But he
didn’t give a complete proof – probably because to him it was
obvious.
    His results prove that it is impossible to construct regular 7-,
11- or 13-gons by Euclidean methods, because these are prime
but not of Fermat type. The analogous equation for the 7-gon, for
instance, is x6 þ x5 þ x4 þ x3 þ x2 þ x þ 1 ¼ 0, and that has degree
6, which is not a power of 2. The 9-gon is not constructible
because 9 is not a product of distinct Fermat primes – it is 363,
and 3 is a Fermat prime, but the same prime occurs twice here.
    The Fermat primes just listed are the only known ones. If there
is another, it must be absolutely gigantic: in the current state of
knowledge the first candidate is 233;554;432 þ 1, where
33;554;432 ¼ 225 . Although we’re still not sure exactly which
regular polygons are constructible, the only obstacle is the
possible existence of very large Fermat primes. A useful website
for Fermat primes is mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatNumber.html
    In 1832 Friedrich Julius Richelot published a construction for
the regular 257-gon. Johann Gustav Hermes of Lingen University
devoted ten years to the 65,537-gon, and his unpublished work
can be found at the University of Göttingen, but it probably
contains errors.
    With more general construction techniques, other numbers
are possible. If you use a gadget for trisecting angles, then the
9-gon is easy. The 7-gon turns out to be possible too, but that’s
