Space-Filling Curves
We ordinarily think of a curve as being much ‘thinner’ than, say,
the interior of a square. For a long time, mathematicians thought
that since a curve is one-dimensional, and a square is two-
dimensional, it must be impossible for a curve to pass through
every point inside a square.
    Not so. In 1890 the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano
discovered just such a space-filling curve. It was infinitely long and
infinitely wiggly, but it still fitted the mathematical concept of a
curve – which basically is some kind of bent line. In this case, very
bent. A year later the German mathematician David Hilbert
found another one. These curves are too complicated to draw –
and if you could, you might as well just draw a solid black square
like the left-hand picture. Mathematicians define space-filling
curves using a step-by-step process that introduces more and
more wiggles. At each step, the new wiggles are finer than the
previous ones. The right-hand picture shows the fifth stage of
this process for Hilbert’s curve.

    There is an excellent animation showing successive stages of
the construction of the Hilbert curve at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Hilbert_curve. Similar curves can fill a solid cube, indeed the
analogue of a cube in any number of dimensions. So examples
like this forced mathematicians to rethink basic concepts, such
as ‘dimension’. Space-filling curves have been proposed as the
