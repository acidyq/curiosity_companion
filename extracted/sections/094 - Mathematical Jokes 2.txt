Mathematical Jokes 2
An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are staying in a
hotel. The engineer wakes up and smells smoke. He goes into the
hallway, sees a fire, fills the wastepaper basket from his room
with water, and pours it on the fire, putting it out.
    Later, the physicist wakes up and smells smoke. He goes into
the hallway and sees a (second) fire. He pulls a fire hose off the
wall. Having calculated the temperature of the exothermic
reaction, the velocity of the flame front, the water pressure in the

hose, and so on, he uses the hose to put out the fire with the
minimum expenditure of energy.
    Later, the mathematician wakes up and smells smoke. He
goes into the hallway and sees a (third) fire. He notices the fire
hose on the wall, and thinks for a moment . . . Then he says, ‘OK,


...........................................
a solution exists!’ – and goes back to bed.
