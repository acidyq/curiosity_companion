Dragon Curve
The picture shows a sequence of curves, called dragon curves
(look at the last one). The sequence can be continued
indefinitely, getting ever more complicated curves.
    What is the rule for making them? Ignore the ‘rounding’ of the
corners by the short lines, which is done so that later curves in
the sequence remain intelligible.

                                                  dragon curves.
