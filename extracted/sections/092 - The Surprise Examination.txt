The Surprise Examination
This paradox is so famous that I nearly left it out. It raises some
intriguing issues.
    Teacher tells the class that there will be a test one day next
week (Monday to Friday), and that it will be a surprise. This
seems reasonable: the teacher can choose any day out of five, and
there is no way that the students can know which day it will be.
But the students don’t see things that way at all. They reason that
the test can’t be on Friday – because if it was, then as soon as
Thursday passed without a test, they’d know it had to be Friday,
so no surprise. And once they’ve ruled out Friday, they apply the
same reasoning to the remaining four days of the week, so the
test can’t be on Thursday, either. In which case it can’t be on
Wednesday, so it can’t be on Tuesday, so it can’t be on Monday.
Apparently, no surprise test is possible.
    That’s all very well, but if the teacher decides to set the test
on Wednesday, there seems to be no way that the students could
actually know the day ahead of time! Is this a genuine paradox or
not?
