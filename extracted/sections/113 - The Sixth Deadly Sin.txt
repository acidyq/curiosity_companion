The Sixth Deadly Sin
It’s envy, and the problem is to avoid it.
     Stefan Banach and Bronislaw Knaster extended Steinhaus’s
method of fair cake division to any number of people, and
simplified it for three people. Their work pretty much summed
up the whole area until a subtle flaw emerged: the procedure may
be fair, but it takes no account of envy. A method is envy-free if no
one thinks that anyone else has got a bigger share than they
have. Every envy-free method is fair, but a fair method need not
be envy-free. And neither Steinhaus’s method, nor that of
Banach and Knaster, is envy-free.
     For example, Belinda may think that Arthur’s division is fair.
Then Steinhaus’s method stops after step 3, and both Arthur and
Belinda consider all three pieces to be of size 1/3. Charlie must
think that his own piece is at least 1/3, so the allocation is
proportional. But if Charlie sees Arthur’s piece as 1/6 and
Belinda’s as 1/2, then he will envy Belinda, because Belinda got
first crack at a piece that Charlie thinks is bigger than his.
     Can you find an envy-free method for dividing a cake among
three people?
