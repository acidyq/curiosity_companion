Archimedes, You Old Fraud!
‘Give me a place to stand, and I will move the Earth.’ So,
famously, said Archimedes, dramatising his newly discovered
law of the lever. Which in this case takes the form

       Force exerted by Archimedes
       6distance from Archimedes to fulcrum
        equals
       Mass of Earth6distance from Earth to fulcrum

The fulcrum is the pivot – the black triangle in the picture:
                        Fractals – The Geometry of Nature // 189




                                                    The law of the
                                                    lever.

     Now, I don’t think Archimedes was interested in the position
of the Earth in space, but he did want the fulcrum to be fixed. (I
know he said ‘a place to stand’, but if the fulcrum moves, all bets
are off, so presumably that’s what he meant.) He also needed a
perfectly rigid lever of zero mass, and he probably didn’t realise
that he also needed uniform gravity, contrary to astronomical
fact, to convert mass to weight. No matter. I don’t want to get
into discussions about inertia or other quibbles. Let’s grant him
all those things. My question is: when the Earth moves, how far
does it move? And can Archimedes achieve the same result more
easily?
