Compensating Errors
The class had been given a sum to do, involving three positive
whole numbers (‘positive’ here means ‘greater than zero’).
During the break, two classmates compared notes.
    ‘Oops. I added the three numbers instead of multiplying
them,’ said George.
    ‘You’re lucky, then,’ said Henrietta. ‘It’s the same answer
either way.’
    What were the three numbers? What would they have been if
there had been only two of them, or four of them, again with
their sum equal to their product?
