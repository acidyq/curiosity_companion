The Ourotorus
Are there higher-dimensional analogues of ouroborean rings?
    For example, there are sixteen 262 squares with entries 0 or
1. Is it possible to write 0’s and 1’s in a 464 square so that each
possibility occurs exactly once as a subsquare? You must pretend
that opposite edges of the square are joined together, so that it
wraps round into an ourotorus.

                                     16 pieces for the
                                     ourotorus puzzle.


    You can turn this puzzle into a game. Cut out the sixteen
pieces shown – the small dot near the top tells you which way up
they go. Can you arrange them in a 464 grid, keeping the dot at
the top, so that adjacent squares have the same colours along
common edges? This rule also applies to squares that become
adjacent if the top and bottom, or the left and right sides, of the
grid are ‘wrapped round’ so that they join.
