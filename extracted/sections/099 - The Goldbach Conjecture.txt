The Goldbach Conjecture
In 2000, as a publicity stunt for Apostolos Doxiadis’s novel Uncle
Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture, the publisher Faber & Faber
offered a million-dollar prize for a proof of the conjecture,
provided it was submitted before April 2002. The prize was never
claimed, which mathematicians did not find surprising, because
the problem has resisted all efforts for more than 250 years.
    It began in 1742, when Christian Goldbach wrote to
Leonhard Euler, suggesting that every even integer is the sum of
two primes. (Apparently René Descartes had come across the
same idea a little earlier, but no one had noticed.) At that time
the number 1 was considered to be prime, so 2 ¼ 1 þ 1 was
acceptable, but nowadays we reformulate the the Goldbach
Conjecture thus: every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of
two primes – often in several different ways. For example,

        4¼2þ2
        6¼3þ3
        8¼5þ3
       10 ¼ 7 þ 3 ¼ 5 þ 5
       12 ¼ 7 þ 5
       14 ¼ 11 þ 3 ¼ 7 þ 7

Euler replied that he was sure Goldbach must be right, but he
couldn’t find a proof – and that remains true today. We do know
that every even integer is the sum of at most six primes – proved
by Olivier Ramaré in 1995. In 1973 Chen Jing-Run proved that
every sufficiently large even integer is the sum of a prime and a
semiprime (either a prime or a product of two primes).
    In 1998 Jean-Marc Deshouillers, Yannick Saouter and
Herman te Riele verified Goldbach’s Conjecture for all even
numbers up to 1014. By 2007, Oliveira e Silva had improved that
to 1018, and his computations continue. If the Riemann
Hypothesis (page 215) is true, then the Odd Goldbach
Conjecture – that every odd integer greater than 5 is the sum of
three primes – is a consequence of the 1998 result.

        Graph showing in how many ways (vertical axis) a given even
        number (horizontal axis) can be expressed as a sum of two
        primes. The lowest points in the graph move upwards as we go
        from left to right, indicating that there are many ways to achieve
        this. However, for all we know an occasional point might fall on
        the horizontal axis. Just one such point would disprove the
        Goldbach Conjecture.

    In 1923 Godfrey Hardy and John Littlewood obtained a
heuristic formula – one that they could not prove rigorously, but
looked plausible – for the number of different ways to write a
given even integer as a sum of two primes. This formula, which
agrees with numerical evidence, indicates that when the number
gets large, there are many ways to write it as a sum of two primes.
Therefore we may expect the smallest of the two primes to be
relatively tiny. In 2001 Jörg Richstein observed that for numbers
up to 1014, the smaller prime is at most 5,569, and this occurs for
       389;965;026;819;938 ¼ 5;569 þ 389;965;814;369
