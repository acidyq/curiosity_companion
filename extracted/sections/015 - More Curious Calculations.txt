More Curious Calculations
The next few calculator curiosities are variations on one basic
theme.

(1) Enter a three-digit number – say 471. Repeat it to get 471,471.

Now divide that number by 7, divide the result by 11, and divide
the result by 13. Here we get

        471;471=7 ¼ 67;353
        67;353=11 ¼ 6;123
         6;123=13 ¼ 471

which is the number you first thought of.
     Try it with other three-digit numbers – you’ll find that
exactly the same trick works.
     Now, mathematics isn’t just about noticing curious things –
it’s also important to find out why they happen. Here we can do
that by reversing the entire calculation. The reverse of division is
multiplication, so – as you can check – the reverse procedure
starts with the three-digit result 471, and gives

          471613 ¼ 6;123
        6;123611 ¼ 67;353
        67;35367 ¼ 471;471

Not terribly helpful as it stands . . . but what this is telling us is
that
       47161361167 ¼ 471;471

So it could be a good idea to see what 1361167 is. Get your
calculator and work this out. What do you notice? Does it
explain the trick?

(2) Another thing mathematicians like to do is ‘generalise’. That
is, they try to find related ideas that work in similar ways.
Suppose we start with a four-digit number, say 4,715. What
should we multiply it by to get 47,154,715? Can we achieve that
in several stages, multiplying by a series of smaller numbers?

To get started, divide 47,154,715 by 4,715.

(3) If your calculator runs to ten digits (nowadays a lot of them
do), what would the corresponding trick be with five-digit
numbers?

(4) If your calculator handles numbers with at least 12 digits, go
back to a three-digit number, say 471 again. This time, instead of
multiplying it by 7, 11 and 13, try multiplying it by 7, then 11,
then 13, then 101, then 9,901. What happens? Why?

(5) Think of a three-digit number, such as 128. Now multiply
repeatedly by 3, 3, 3, 7, 11, 13 and 37. (Yes, three multiplications
by 3.) The result is 127,999,872 – nothing special here. So add the
number your first thought of: 128. Now what do you get?
