Magic Stars
Here is a five-pointed star. It is a magic star because the numbers
on any line of four circles add up to the same total, 24. But it’s
not a very good magic pentacle, because it doesn’t use the
numbers from 1 to 10. Instead, it uses the numbers from 1 to 12
with 7 and 11 missing.




                                     Five-pointed magic star.
                                     Numbers are not consecutive.


    It turns out that this is the best you can do with a five-
pointed star. But if you use a six-pointed star, it is possible to
place the numbers 1 to 12 in the circles, using one of each, so
that each line of four numbers has the same total. (As a hint, the
total has to be 26.) And, just to make the puzzle harder, I want
you to make the six outermost numbers add up to 26 as well.
    Where do the numbers go?




                                     Write the numbers 1 to 12 in
                                     the circles to make this star
                                     magic.
