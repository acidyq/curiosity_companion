To Find Fake Coin
In February 2003 Harold Hopwood of Gravesend wrote a short
letter to the Daily Telegraph, saying that he had solved the
newspaper’s crossword every day since 1937, but one conun-
drum had been nagging away at the back of his mind since his
schooldays, and at the age of 82 he had finally decided to enlist
some help.
    The puzzle was this. You are given 12 coins. They all have the
same weight, except for one, which may be either lighter or
heavier than the rest. You have to find out which coin is
different, and whether it is light or heavy, using at most three
weighings on a pair of scales. The scales have no graduations for
weights; they just have two pans, and you can tell whether they
are in balance, or the heavier one has gone down and the lighter
one has gone up.




       Exactly one coin is either light or heavy: find out which in three
       weighings.

    Before reading on, you should have a go. It’s quite addictive.
    Within days, the paper’s letters desk had received 362 letters
and calls about the puzzle, nearly all asking for the answer, and
they phoned me. I recognised the problem as one of the classic
puzzles, typical of the ‘weights and scales’ genre, but I’d
forgotten the answer. But my friend Marty, who happened to be
in the room when I answered the phone, also recognised the
problem. The same puzzle had inspired him as a teenager, and
his successful solution had led him to become a mathematician.
    Of course he had forgotten how the solution went, but we

came up with a method in which we weighed various sets of
coins against various others, and faxed it to the newspaper.
     In fact, there are many answers, including a very clever one
which I finally remembered on the day that the Telegraph printed
our less elegant method. I had seen it twenty years earlier in New
Scientist magazine, and it had been reproduced in Thomas H.
O’Beirne’s Puzzles and Paradoxes, which I had on my bookshelf.
     Puzzles like this seem to come round every twenty years or so,
presumably when a new generation is exposed to them, a bit like
an epidemic that gets a new lease of life when the population
loses all immunity. O’Beirne traced it back to Howard Grossman
in 1945, but it is almost certainly much older, going back to the
seventeenth century. It wouldn’t surprise me if one day we find it
on a Babylonian cuneiform tablet.
     O’Beirne offered a ‘decision tree’ solution, along the lines
that Marty and I had concocted. He also recalled the elegant
1950 solution published by ‘Blanche Descartes’ in Eureka, the
journal of the Archimedeans, Cambridge University’s under-
graduate mathematics society. Ms Descartes was in actuality
Cedric A.B. Smith, and his solution is a masterpiece of ingenuity.
It is presented as a poem about a certain Professor Felix
Fiddlesticks, and the main idea goes like this:
       F set the coins out in a row
            And chalked on each a letter, so,
       To form the words ‘F AM NOT LICKED’
            (An idea in his brain had clicked.)
       And now his mother he’ll enjoin:
            MA DO LIKE
            ME TO FIND
            FAKE COIN
This cryptic list of three weighings, one set of four against
another, solves the problem, as Eureka explains, also in verse. To
convince you, I’m going to list all the outcomes of the
weighings, according to which coin is heavy or light. Here

L means that the left pan goes down, R that the right pan goes
down, and – means they stay balanced.

You can check that no two possibilities give the same results.
    The Telegraph’s publication of a valid solution did not end the
matter. Readers wrote in to object to our answer, on spurious
grounds. They wrote to improve it, not always by valid methods.
They e-mailed to point out Ms Descartes’s solution or similar
ones. They told us about other weighing puzzles. They thanked
us for setting their minds at rest. They cursed us for reopening an
old wound. It was as if some vast, secret reservoir of folk wisdom
had suddenly been breached. One correspondent remembered

that the puzzle had featured on BBC television in the 1960s, with
the solution being given the following night. Ominously, the
letter continued, ‘I do not recall why it was raised in the first
place, or whether that was my first acquaintance with it; I have a
