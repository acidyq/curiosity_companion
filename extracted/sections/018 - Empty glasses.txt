Empty Glasses
I have five glasses in a row. The first three are full and the other
two empty. How can I arrange them so that they are alternately
full and empty, by moving only one glass?




                                                    Start like this
                                                    ...



                                                    ... and end up
                                                    like this,
                                                    moving only
                                                    one glass.
